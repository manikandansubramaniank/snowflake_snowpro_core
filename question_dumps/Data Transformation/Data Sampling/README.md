basic types like numerical values, dates, and strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Binary data (A), which represents raw bytes, is not directly analyzed for classification due to its unstructured                                                                                                                                               
nature. Snowflake's data classification requires identifiable patterns, which are hard to extract from binary                                                                                                                                                  
data. Geography (C), another data type in Snowflake, which stores geospatial data, also isn't a focus for                                                                                                                                                      
classification as its patterns are too complex for the standard classification methods. Variant (D) columns,

Float (B), representing floating-point numbers, is suitable for data classification because it can be analyzed                                                                                                                                                 
using numerical ranges, distributions, and patterns, allowing the classification engine to detect potential                                                                                                                                                    
sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identification numbers. The classifier looks for                                                                                                                                                       
patterns that fall within predefined ranges or characteristics that suggest potentially sensitive information.                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, among the options provided, Float is the most suitable data type for Snowflake's data

The correct answer is B. select * from testtable sample (0); because it explicitly requests a 0% sample of the                                                                                                                                                 
table, which will invariably return an empty result set.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
The SAMPLE clause in Snowflake is used to retrieve a subset of rows from a table. It offers different methods                                                                                                                                                  
for specifying the sample size, primarily percentage-based sampling and row-based sampling.                                                                                                                                                                    
SAMPLE (percentage): Returns approximately the specified percentage of rows from the table. A percentage                                                                                                                                                       
of 0 returns no rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Let's analyze the other options:                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
A. select * from testtable sample ();: This syntax is incorrect and will likely result in a syntax error. The                                                                                                                                                  
SAMPLE clause requires a specification of the sample size, be it a percentage or a number of rows. Omitting                                                                                                                                                    
the argument makes the statement invalid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
C. select * from testtable sample (null);: While NULL represents the absence of a value, passing NULL to the                                                                                                                                                   
SAMPLE clause would not be interpreted as taking an empty sample. Its behavior might be unpredictable,                                                                                                                                                         
resulting in an error, or possibly taking a very small sample dependent on internal Snowflake processing, but                                                                                                                                                  
is not guaranteed to return an empty set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
D. select * from testtable sample (none);: NONE is not a recognized keyword or function within the SAMPLE                                                                                                                                                      
clause's syntax in Snowflake SQL. Thus, this statement is syntactically incorrect and will result in an error.                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake does not interpret "none" in this context to mean an empty sample.                                                                                                                                                                                   
In conclusion, SAMPLE (0) is the only option that correctly adheres to Snowflake's syntax for sampling and                                                                                                                                                     
explicitly specifies a 0% sample, thereby ensuring an empty result set. The other options either containsyntax errors or do not reliably guarantee an empty sample. Therefore, option B is the unambiguous and

What does it mean when the sample function uses the Bernoulli sampling method?

The correct answer is A: The data is based on sampling every row. Bernoulli sampling, as implemented inSnowflake's SAMPLE function, operates on a row-by-row basis. It independently evaluates each row against                                                
the specified sampling probability. In simpler terms, each row has a chance of being included in the sample                                                                                                                                                    
based on the defined percentage (e.g., SAMPLE(10) would give each row a 10% probability of being included).                                                                                                                                                    
This is unlike block sampling which samples groups of rows at a time or fixed sampling that would only return                                                                                                                                                  
a set number of rows. The key distinction of Bernoulli sampling is the independence of selection per row.                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, option A accurately describes how Bernoulli sampling functions. Option B and D are incorrect as                                                                                                                                                     
they do not necessarily define how bernoulli sampling works and option C is incorrect as bernoulli sampling                                                                                                                                                    
samples rows, not blocks of data. This method provides a statistically representative sample, particularly                                                                                                                                                     
useful when needing a smaller dataset for analysis or testing. The probability is provided as a percentage and                                                                                                                                                 
not a block of rows, or fixed number of rows. For further information on sampling methods in Snowflake, you

The query SELECT * FROM gold_data TABLESAMPLE (100); utilizes the TABLESAMPLE clause in Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                             
This clause, when followed by a percentage, intends to return a random sample of the table's rows based on                                                                                                                                                     
that percentage. However, crucial to understanding its behavior is that percentages are used without a                                                                                                                                                         
percentage sign in Snowflake’s TABLESAMPLE clause. Therefore, when we specify TABLESAMPLE (100),                                                                                                                                                               
we're not requesting 100% of the rows, but rather using the literal value 100. Since TABLESAMPLE interprets                                                                                                                                                    
the provided numerical value as a percentage, 100 means selecting 100% of the table's rows, regardless of                                                                                                                                                      
the table size. Consequently, the query will effectively return the entire table's content. It is important to note

table has 1000 rows, all 1000 rows will be displayed. Thus the query is not producing a sample of the table, butthe whole table. A common mistake is thinking it means return 100 random rows, which is not the case. This                                     
differs from mechanisms that return a specific number of rows like the 'limit' clause. The query does not

The correct answer is D. SAMPLE. The SAMPLE command in Snowflake SQL is specifically designed to                                                                                                                                                               
retrieve a random subset of rows from a table. It operates by selecting a percentage or a fixed number of rows                                                                                                                                                 
from the original table using a random sampling algorithm. This is useful for exploratory data analysis, testingqueries against representative datasets, and building machine learning models where using the entire dataset                                   
might be computationally expensive or unnecessary. Options A, B, and C are for different purposes:                                                                                                                                                             
GENERATOR creates a table containing a specific number of rows with specified values, not for sampling.

The correct answer is B. Data classification. Data classification within Snowflake is specifically designed to                                                                                                                                                 
identify and categorize data based on sensitivity levels. This feature uses built-in and customizable classifiers                                                                                                                                              
to automatically scan columns and tag them with labels like "PII," "Confidential," or "Financial." These labels

The correct answer is B because Snowflake's SAMPLE clause utilizes different syntaxes for                                                                                                                                                                      
percentage-based and row-based sampling. When sampling by percentage, you specify a numeric                                                                                                                                                                    
value between 0 and 100, representing the desired percentage of rows. Option B uses SAMPLE                                                                                                                                                                     
(10), which, in Snowflake, correctly interprets '10' as a percentage. Thus, it returns a sample where                                                                                                                                                          
approximately 10% of the rows from testtable are included. Options A and C are incorrect because                                                                                                                                                               
they use decimal numbers (0.1), which would be interpreted as a percentage of 0.1%, not 10%.                                                                                                                                                                   
Option D is incorrect because SAMPLE (10 rows) specifies row-based sampling, returning a                                                                                                                                                                       
maximum of 10 rows, not a 10% sample. The question asks for a 10% probability of inclusion, and                                                                                                                                                                
percentage-based sampling is the appropriate approach. It doesn't directly mean 10% of the exact

The correct answer is C: SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE SAMPLE (5 ROWS);.                                                                                                                                                                                              
Sampling in Snowflake allows you to select a random subset of data from a table. The                                                                                                                                                                           
SAMPLE clause offers different methods for achieving this. SAMPLE SYSTEM and                                                                                                                                                                                   
SAMPLE BERNOULLI both return an approximate percentage of rows, not a fixed                                                                                                                                                                                    
number. These methods work by selecting blocks or individual rows based on a                                                                                                                                                                                   
probability, meaning the exact number of rows returned will vary depending on the data                                                                                                                                                                         
distribution and the sampling method. They are useful for quickly getting a                                                                                                                                                                                    
representative sample of large datasets, but don't guarantee a precise number of rows.Option A, SAMPLE SYSTEM (5), attempts to sample 5% of the table using system                                                                                             
sampling. With 10 rows, this will likely return fewer than 5 rows, and it isn't guaranteed                                                                                                                                                                     
to return exactly half. Option B, SAMPLE BERNOULLI (5), similarly attempts to sample                                                                                                                                                                           
approximately 5% of the rows using Bernoulli sampling, which again doesn't ensure                                                                                                                                                                              
exactly 5 rows are returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option D, SAMPLE SYSTEM (1) SEED (5), still selects an approximate 1% of the table.                                                                                                                                                                            
The SEED clause guarantees that the same sample is returned every time the query is                                                                                                                                                                            
run. However, because the percentage sample is low, and because the table only has 10                                                                                                                                                                          
rows, the query is very unlikely to return exactly 5 rows, but rather 0 rows. Furthermore,                                                                                                                                                                     
while repeatable with a seed, the query will not return exactly 5 rows every time.                                                                                                                                                                             
In contrast, SAMPLE (5 ROWS) guarantees the retrieval of exactly 5 rows from the table,                                                                                                                                                                        
provided the table contains at least 5 rows. The query will select a random subset of 5                                                                                                                                                                        
rows. Because the table has 10 rows, such sampling is possible. Thus the correct answer
