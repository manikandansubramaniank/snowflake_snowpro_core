The correct answer is C, "Both of the above." The FLATTEN function in Snowflake is explicitly designed to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
handle semi-structured data, but it can also be effectively used in conjunction with structured data for certain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
transformations and manipulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
FLATTEN's primary purpose is to expand arrays and objects contained within semi-structured data formats                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
like JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet, and XML into a relational form, making it easier to query. It iterates through the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
elements within a variant column, creating a new row for each element. This is essential because querying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
nested data without flattening would be significantly more complex and less efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
However, FLATTEN can also be applied to structured data scenarios, especially when working with array-like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
structures within relational tables. Imagine a scenario where a column in a structured table contains a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
comma-separated list or an array-like string. FLATTEN, along with functions like SPLIT_TO_TABLE, can be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
utilized to deconstruct this data into multiple rows, effectively transforming structured data into a format that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
can be analyzed more granularly. While not its core function, it extends the analytical capabilities when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
dealing with list-like data in relational databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, while FLATTEN is most commonly associated with and fundamentally designed for semistructured data, its utility extends to structured data when data transformations involving array-like or listlike representations within columns are required. Hence, the ability to process both structured and semistructured data makes option C the most accurate.

LATERAL FLATTEN command. LATERAL FLATTEN is a table function used to expand semi-structured data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
such as JSON or arrays, into a relational format. The PATH column reflects the location within the semistructured data where the current element was extracted. This can be a key within a JSON object or an array                                                                                                                                                                   
index. The INDEX column, pertinent to arrays, indicates the numerical position of the element within the array.

Snowflake does infer and store the datatype internally, but does not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
surface it as an explicit output column from LATERAL FLATTEN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Essentially, the returned value and its location are essential for understanding the structure after flattening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The PATH and INDEX columns are crucial for reassembling or navigating through the original semi-structured

The correct answer is C. FLATTEN. The FLATTEN table function in Snowflake is explicitly designed to convert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
semi-structured data, such as JSON, Avro, or Parquet, into a relational format suitable for querying with SQL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
It achieves this by "exploding" the nested structures within the semi-structured data into separate rows.

resulting row represents a flattened element from the input data, typically including columns for the key,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
index (for arrays), and the value of the element. This process effectively transforms data that's not inherently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
tabular into a tabular representation, enabling joins, filters, and other relational operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
CHECK_JSONB and PARSE_JSON are not table functions and serve different purposes. PARSE_JSON is a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
scalar function that parses a JSON string into a variant data type; it doesn't convert it into a relational format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Similarly, CHECK_JSONB isn't a standard Snowflake function, though a user defined function could have this

The FLATTEN function in Snowflake is designed to explode complex semi-structured data, such as JSON or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
arrays, into relational rows. When you apply FLATTEN, it doesn't just provide the raw data; instead, it gives you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
a structured representation of the data's hierarchical elements. The primary columns returned are KEY and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
VALUE. The KEY column indicates the key within the current level of the semi-structured data being                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
flattened. For a JSON object, this would be the field name. For an array, it is the index of each element starting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
at zero. The VALUE column contains the actual value associated with that particular key or index. It could be a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
simple scalar value like a string, number, or a nested JSON object or array. The NODE, LEVEL, and ROOT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
columns are not directly returned by the FLATTEN function itself. While these concepts relate to the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
structure, FLATTEN mainly exposes the key-value pairs at the targeted flattening level. It is important tounderstand that FLATTEN generates a set of rows, each reflecting a single level of the hierarchical data,                                                                                                                                                                  
where the KEY identifies the path to access the VALUE. By utilizing these returned columns, you can then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
manipulate and query the formerly nested elements as relational data.

The correct answer is B. FLATTEN. The FLATTEN function in Snowflake is specifically designed to produce a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
lateral view of complex data structures like VARIANT columns, which often store semi-structured data such                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
as JSON or arrays. FLATTEN transforms a single row containing a complex element into multiple rows,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
effectively unnesting the structure. This makes it easier to work with the individual elements within the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
VARIANT data. The LATERAL aspect of the view means that the output of FLATTEN is applied row-by-row,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
allowing access to fields within the VARIANT for each original row. In contrast, GET_PATH (A) retrieves values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
from specific paths within a VARIANT, but does not expand rows. GET (C) is a more general function for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
extracting data, but is not designed for lateral expansion and typically works on a single key. PARSE_JSON                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
(D) parses a string into a JSON VARIANT but doesn't perform lateral unnesting. Therefore, FLATTEN is the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
only function that fits the requirements of generating a lateral view from a VARIANT column, effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
turning a single complex record into multiple related records which is necessary for analysis and reporting.

The correct answer is B. FLATTEN. The FLATTEN function in Snowflake is specifically designed to expand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
semi-structured data, such as VARIANT, OBJECT, or ARRAY columns, into a relational, row-based format. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
operation is crucial for querying nested data structures effectively. FLATTEN essentially creates a separate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
row for each element within the input structure. This transforms complex, hierarchical data into a tabular                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
structure that standard SQL can easily process. This process is necessary when extracting individual values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
from arrays or objects for analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
CAST (option A) is used for type conversions between different data types, not for expanding nested                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
structures. GET (option C) retrieves a single element from a VARIANT or OBJECT using a specified key or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
index, but it does not produce a row for each element in the structure. PARSE_JSON (option D) converts a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
string into a JSON document (VARIANT), it does not expand it into rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, only FLATTEN is capable of achieving the task of generating a new row for each object within a

that doesn't address the core need for optimal query performance; it's better for accessing data without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
transformations. Flattening also avoids the cost of repeatedly parsing VARIANT columns, especially when

The LATERAL modifier, when used with the FLATTEN function in Snowflake, doesn't directly cast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
data types, extract paths, or retrieve single instances of repeating elements within the flattenedstructure. Its primary purpose is to enable a correlated subquery-like behavior during the                                                                                                                                                                                         
flattening process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Specifically, without LATERAL, FLATTEN operates on a single row of the input table, generating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
flattened rows based on the array or object within that row. However, with LATERAL, the output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
of the FLATTEN function for each row is combined with the other columns of the original row. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
allows you to join the flattened data with other data from the same or different tables based on a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
common key or other relationship. It allows you to work on each element of a nested object/array                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and join the resulting rows with the rest of the row’s information. Think of it as a way to create a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
result set where each flattened element is aware of the context of the original row from which it

Essentially, LATERAL effectively allows for a row-by-row join, linking data

The absence of LATERAL makes this kind of correlated operation
