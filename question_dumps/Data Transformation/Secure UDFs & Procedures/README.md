What should be considered when deciding to use a Secure View? (Choose two.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
A. No details of the query execution plan will be available in the query profiler.<br>B. Once created there is no way to determine if a view is secure or not.<br>C. Secure views do not take advantage of the same internal optimizations as standard views.<br>D. It is not possible to create secure materialized views.<br>E. The view definition of a secure view is still visible to users by way of the information schema.

The correct answer is AC. Secure Views in Snowflake are designed to protect sensitive data by controlling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
access at the row level and column level, without revealing the underlying query logic or data structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
A is correct because Secure Views do indeed hide the execution plan from the query profiler. This is a key                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
security feature, as it prevents users from understanding how the query is being executed, potentially                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
exposing underlying data access patterns. This obfuscation limits insights into data sources and join                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
strategies, safeguarding against reverse engineering and data exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
C is correct because Secure Views often do not benefit from the same level of optimization as regular views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake might have to perform extra steps during processing for secure views to enforce the data masking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
and row level security. This can sometimes lead to slight performance overhead compared to a standard view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Consequently, you should carefully consider performance implications when choosing a secure view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
B is incorrect because Snowflake provides ways to identify whether a view is secure or not. Using the SHOW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
VIEWS command and inspecting the is_secure property allows one to check the security status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
D is incorrect since it is possible to create secure materialized views. Materialized views are a separate object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
type that can be either secure or not. The security attribute is managed similarly to non-materialized views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
E is incorrect because a core feature of Secure Views is that their definition is hidden from users in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
information schema. The query logic itself is masked ensuring that users cannot glean sensitive details aboutdata structures or column mappings via information schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, the primary considerations when choosing to use a Secure View should be the potential loss of

content directly from PDF files stored in stages using built-in functions like FLATTEN, Window functions, or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
HyperLogLog (HLL) functions. These functions serve different purposes: FLATTEN is for flattening semistructured data, window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
current row, and HLL functions are for cardinality estimation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Extracting content from PDFs requires specialized libraries capable of parsing the PDF format. A Java UDF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
provides a mechanism to extend Snowflake's functionality by incorporating external Java code. You can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
include a Java library such as PDFBox or iText within a UDF to parse the PDF files located in a Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
stage. The UDF then reads the PDF file from the stage, uses the library to extract the text or other data, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
returns the extracted content as a string or other suitable data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The process typically involves creating a Java class with a method that takes the stage path of the PDF as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
input, uses the Java PDF library to read and parse the file, and returns the desired content. You then upload                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
the compiled JAR file to an internal stage in Snowflake and register the UDF, pointing it to the Java class and

The correct answer is D. Java User-Defined Function (UDF). Snowflake's built-in functions like FLATTEN,

Extracting text from PDFs requires more sophisticated parsing logic, often involving libraries capable of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
understanding the PDF file format. This functionality is not available natively in Snowflake SQL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Java UDFs allow you to extend Snowflake's capabilities by writing custom code in Java that can interact with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
external libraries. In this case, a Java UDF could leverage a PDF parsing library like Apache PDFBox or iText to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
read the PDF binary data from a stage, extract the text, and return it as a result usable within Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The FLATTEN function (A) is used for unnesting array or object structures, and it is not suitable for parsing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
binary PDF content. Window functions (B) operate on sets of rows and are for analytical purposes, not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
document extraction. HLL functions (C) estimate the cardinality of sets and are irrelevant here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Therefore, a Java UDF is the most appropriate method to handle the specific task of reading and parsing the

A Snowflake user is writing a User-Defined Function (UDF) with some unqualified object names.

A. Snowflake will resolve them according to the SEARCH_PATH parameter.<br>B. Snowflake will only check the schema the UDF belongs to.<br>C. Snowflake will first check the current schema, and then the schema the previous query used.<br>D.

The correct answer is B. Snowflake will only check the schema the UDF belongs to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
When a User-Defined Function (UDF) in Snowflake executes, unqualified object names (like table or view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
names without a specified schema) are resolved within the context of the UDF's own schema, not the user's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
current session schema or any search path. This isolation ensures the UDF's behavior is predictable and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
consistent, independent of where it's called from. Snowflake prioritizes the UDF's schema for resolving                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
unqualified names. If an object isn't found within that schema, the UDF execution will fail.

The correct answer is indeed A. Secure views execute slowly compared to non-secure views. This stems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
from the fundamental difference in how Snowflake handles access control and query processing for these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
view types. Secure views enforce row-level and column-level security at query time. This means Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
must meticulously check the privileges of the user executing the query against the data underlying the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
secure view. This constant security evaluation introduces overhead, resulting in slower execution compared to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
non-secure views. Non-secure views, in contrast, simply present a pre-defined query's result set, skipping                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
these additional security checks. They lack the granularity of access control offered by secure views. While                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
secure views prioritize data protection, they come at the cost of performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Therefore, option B is incorrect because non-secure views are not preferred when sharing sensitive data;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
secure views are the appropriate choice. Option C is also incorrect as secure views do not function similarly to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
materialized views regarding performance. Materialized views typically offer faster query performance due to

Option D is incorrect because,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
as explained, there are performance differences, with secure views typically performing slower.

layer of access control inherent to secure views inevitably impacts their speed.

The question asks about languages that require inline handlers for Snowflake UserDefined Functions (UDFs). Inline UDF handlers mean the code defining the function logicmust be directly embedded within the CREATE FUNCTION statement. Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                 
supports multiple languages for UDFs, and not all require inline handlers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
JavaScript and SQL are the two languages that mandate inline handlers within the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CREATE FUNCTION statement when used for UDFs in Snowflake. This design is because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
both languages are interpreted and can be directly parsed and executed by the

Scala, and Python, on the other hand, support writing UDF handlers in external files,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
which can then be referenced in the CREATE FUNCTION statement, allowing for more
