Which SQL commands, when committed, will consume a stream and advance the stream offset? (Choose two.)

incorrect, regarding Snowflake stream consumption and offset advancement:Correct Answers: A and C                                                                                                                                                                                                
A. UPDATE TABLE FROM STREAM: When an UPDATE statement incorporates data from a stream, Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                 
processes the new data entries within the stream and applies the updates to the target table. The act of                                                                                                                                                                                         
applying these changes effectively consumes the stream data that was read by the UPDATE command. Upon                                                                                                                                                                                            
successful commit of the transaction, the stream's offset is advanced, marking that data as processed.                                                                                                                                                                                           
C. INSERT INTO TABLE SELECT FROM STREAM: Similar to the UPDATE statement, using INSERT with a                                                                                                                                                                                                    
SELECT from a stream causes Snowflake to read and insert the stream's data into the specified table. The                                                                                                                                                                                         
stream's data is consumed as it is incorporated into the table. When the transaction containing the INSERT                                                                                                                                                                                       
command is committed, the stream's offset progresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Incorrect Answers: B, D, and E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
B. SELECT FROM STREAM: A SELECT statement, used to query a stream, only reads the stream's data. It                                                                                                                                                                                              
doesn't perform any modifications or consume the data. The stream's offset remains unchanged after a                                                                                                                                                                                             
SELECT operation as the data is not moved or transformed in a way that requires consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
D. ALTER TABLE AS SELECT FROM STREAM: The ALTER TABLE AS SELECT command recreates or                                                                                                                                                                                                             
modifies the target table based on the results of the SELECT. While the SELECT part of this operation does                                                                                                                                                                                       
read from a stream, the ALTER TABLE part does not consume stream data for its modification. This command                                                                                                                                                                                         
will read stream data to create new table structure, but the data that this table gets is based on the query                                                                                                                                                                                     
made from it. Therefore the stream offset will NOT be advanced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
E. BEGIN COMMIT: BEGIN and COMMIT are transactional control statements. BEGIN initiates a transaction,                                                                                                                                                                                           
and COMMIT concludes it by permanently saving the changes made within the transaction. These commands                                                                                                                                                                                            
are necessary for any data manipulation that will advance the stream offset but they, themselves, do not                                                                                                                                                                                         
directly consume stream data. They allow other statements to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Key Concept: Stream Consumption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
In Snowflake, a stream acts as a change data capture (CDC) mechanism. It tracks changes made to a source                                                                                                                                                                                         
table. SQL commands that consume the stream are those that move or transform the data from the stream to                                                                                                                                                                                         
another location. Commands which only query the stream do not consume the stream. When a transaction                                                                                                                                                                                             
including a stream-consuming command is committed, the stream's internal offset moves forward, marking                                                                                                                                                                                           
that the processed data has been read and prevents it from being read again. If the transaction was to be                                                                                                                                                                                        
rolled back the stream offset would not move. This provides transactional consistency.

Here's a detailed justification for why Streams are the correct answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Streams in Snowflake are designed specifically to track Data Manipulation Language (DML) changes made to                                                                                                                                                                                         
tables, providing a change data capture (CDC) mechanism. When inserts, updates, or deletes occur on a                                                                                                                                                                                            
source table, the stream records these changes. A stream only tracks changes; it does not store the entire                                                                                                                                                                                       
source table's data. This makes streams an efficient way to monitor data modifications without the overhead                                                                                                                                                                                      
of duplicating the entire table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Pipes, on the other hand, are used for continuous data ingestion. They automate the process of loading data                                                                                                                                                                                      
from external stages into Snowflake tables but do not track DML changes after the data has been loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                          
Tasks are used to schedule SQL statements, including data transformations and loading, but they do not                                                                                                                                                                                           
inherently track DML changes on a table in the way streams do. Procedures are stored blocks of SQL code                                                                                                                                                                                          
that can perform various operations, but like Tasks, they don't automatically track DML changes; custom logic                                                                                                                                                                                    
would need to be written to achieve such tracking. Streams track what rows have changed, including whichwere inserted, deleted, or updated, along with metadata about the changes.                                                                                                               
Therefore, only Streams have the built-in capability to track the specified types of DML operations.

The correct answer is A. MAX_DATA_EXTENSION_TIME_IN_DAYS. Streams in Snowflake track changes to                                                                                                                                                                                                  
tables, providing a way to implement change data capture (CDC). When a table is modified, the stream records                                                                                                                                                                                     
these changes. However, streams can become "stale" if they are not consumed within a certain period. This                                                                                                                                                                                        
staleness occurs because Snowflake may purge historical data, including the change tracking information

The MAX_DATA_EXTENSION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter, configurable at the table level, prevents streams                                                                                                                                                                                                 
from becoming stale by controlling the maximum number of days that the historical change tracking data is

Options B, C, and D are not related to preventing stream staleness. MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS                                                                                                                                                                                              
(B) defines the minimum number of days that historical data is retained, but doesn't control change tracking                                                                                                                                                                                     
for streams specifically. LOCK_TIMEOUT (C) is related to session locking, not data retention. STALE_AFTER                                                                                                                                                                                        
(D) isnâ€™t a standard Snowflake parameter related to stream behavior. Therefore,

The correct answer is C. Stream. Streams in Snowflake are database objects designed specifically to track                                                                                                                                                                                        
Data Manipulation Language (DML) changes made to tables, views, or external tables. They act as change                                                                                                                                                                                           
data capture (CDC) mechanisms, recording inserts, updates, and deletes. Unlike Snowpipes, which are used                                                                                                                                                                                         
for continuous data loading, streams focus on tracking changes to existing data. Stages, on the other hand,

operations and do not inherently record DML changes. A stream maintains a record of the changes,                                                                                                                                                                                                 
essentially a change log, that can be queried and processed, enabling downstream applications and                                                                                                                                                                                                
processes to consume the changes since a specific point in time. This makes them ideal for scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                             
requiring data auditing, replication, or incremental data processing. Streams do not store data themselves;                                                                                                                                                                                      
they maintain a set of metadata referencing the data changes. When a stream is queried, it returns the delta                                                                                                                                                                                     
in data modifications, not the entire tableâ€™s content. Consequently, streams allow for efficient, differential                                                                                                                                                                                   
processing of table changes.

Streams are the Snowflake objects that track Data Manipulation Language (DML) changes made to tables.                                                                                                                                                                                            
They record metadata about changes such as inserts, updates, and deletes. This change data capture (CDC)                                                                                                                                                                                         
functionality allows downstream processes to act upon only the changed data, rather than re-processing                                                                                                                                                                                           
entire tables. When a DML operation occurs on a base table, a stream effectively captures the "before" and

The correct answer is C. Insert-only. Here's why: Snowflake streams are designed to track changes in tables,                                                                                                                                                                                     
enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality. Different stream types cater to specific use cases. A                                                                                                                                                                                          
standard stream tracks all DML changes (inserts, updates, deletes) on a table. An append-only stream only                                                                                                                                                                                        
tracks inserts; any updates or deletes are not captured. An insert-only stream is specifically tailored for                                                                                                                                                                                      
external tables. External tables, by definition, point to data residing outside of Snowflake's managed storage.                                                                                                                                                                                  
As such, Snowflake cannot directly track updates and deletes on these external files. Insert-only streams                                                                                                                                                                                        
provide a practical approach by tracking newly appended data to the external storage locations. This design                                                                                                                                                                                      
ensures that any new files or records added to the external source can be identified and processed by                                                                                                                                                                                            
Snowflake. Using append-only streams on standard tables is suitable for tracking only inserts, while an insertonly stream is specifically designed to track only inserts into external tables. These limitations stem from                                                                       
Snowflakeâ€™s inability to perform transactional DML operations on external files directly, hence the need for                                                                                                                                                                                     
specialized stream type for external tables. This is not the case for standard tables, where Snowflake can

The correct answer is C. Stream. Snowflake Streams are the designated feature for change data

data at a specific time, Streams track changes incrementally. They do not store the data itself;

A. The data retention period s reduced to a minimum of 14 days.<br>B. The data retention period is permanently extended for the table.<br>C. The data retention period is temporarily extended to the streamâ€™s offset.<br>D. The data retention period is not affected by the stream consumption.

Streams in Snowflake are specifically designed to track Data Manipulation Language

and don't store copies of the table data, only the metadata about the changes. This                                                                                                                                                                                                              
makes them efficient for capturing data modifications. Tags, Tasks, and Stored                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Procedures do not inherently fulfill the role of tracking data changes like Streams do.                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Tags are used for metadata labeling, Tasks are for scheduling SQL code execution, and                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Stored Procedures are for encapsulating logic. While you might incorporate Streams into                                                                                                                                                                                                          
a Stored Procedure, that would not be the primary function of the procedure itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Streams provide the ability to query data that has changed in a table, enabling
