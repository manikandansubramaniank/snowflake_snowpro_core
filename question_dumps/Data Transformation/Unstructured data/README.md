These arrays can contain various data types and are not limited by rigid schema rules, enabling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
representation of non-tabular data structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Option D, "Object," is also correct. Snowflake supports storing semi-structured data as objects, essentially

Here's a detailed justification for why option B is the correct answer when retrieving unstructured data from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake data storage, along with why the other options are incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option B, stating that SQL functions can be used to create different types of URLs pointing to theunstructured data, which can then be used to download the data to a client, is the most accurate. Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
supports external functions and user-defined functions (UDFs) that can be used to generate pre-signed URLs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(also known as staged URLs) for accessing unstructured data stored in external stages like AWS S3, Azure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. These pre-signed URLs provide temporary access to the data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
allowing clients to download it directly from the storage location without needing direct access to Snowflake

It is in line with best practices for cloud storage access control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Option A is less accurate. While the GET command can move data out of Snowflake to a client, it's primarily

external storage service through Snowflake. The question describes retrieving data that is already in storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Option C is incorrect. The query result cache is used to store the results of SQL queries. While you might

Option D is also incorrect. While web extensions exist to display various file types within web browsers,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake doesn't inherently call on these extensions to display unstructured data directly within the
