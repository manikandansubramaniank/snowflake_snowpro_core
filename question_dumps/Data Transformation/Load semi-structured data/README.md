The correct answer is C. STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY. Snowflake's COPY command, used for loading data from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
external files, offers options to handle various file structures. When dealing with JSON files containing a toplevel array of JSON objects, without STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY the entire array would be treated as a single row,                                                                                                                                                                                                         
rather than creating multiple rows from the individual objects. The STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY parameter

The correct answer is D. VARIANT. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Snowflake's VARIANT data type is designed specifically for handling semi-structured data, like JSON or Avro,where the schema might be inconsistent or evolve over time. Unlike ARRAY or OBJECT, which enforce a more

This flexibility is crucial when the user is uncertain about future operations, as it avoids the need to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
define a strict schema upfront or alter it frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
TEXT data type, while suitable for string-based information, is not optimal for semi-structured data that might                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
have complex hierarchies or multiple data types within it. Storing semi-structured data as text would hinder

The correct answer is B because OBJECT_CONSTRUCT is a Snowflake function that transforms relational                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
data (rows and columns) into a JSON-like structure represented as a VARIANT data type. When used with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
COPY INTO, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT essentially packages each row of a table into a single VARIANT column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This is particularly useful when exporting data to formats that work well with semi-structured data, such as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
JSON or Avro, as the VARIANT type can seamlessly hold complex data structures. Instead of unloading                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
individual columns separately, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT enables you to unload the complete structure of each                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
row as a single, flexible entity. Option A, reordering rows, is generally unrelated to OBJECT_CONSTRUCT and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
handled by other clauses like ORDER BY. Option C, reordering data columns based on target definitions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
would be more aligned with column mapping during the COPY INTO operation, not OBJECT_CONSTRUCT’s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
transformation. Option D, transforming source file rows, is incorrect because OBJECT_CONSTRUCT is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
within the SQL context while operating on existing table data, not on the raw data in source files during                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
loading. It functions as an operation to transform existing tabular data to a variant data type when the copy is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
executed. Therefore, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT’s purpose in COPY INTO is to convert the relational data into a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
VARIANT column, making it suitable for unloading data to semi-structured formats. This capability leverages
