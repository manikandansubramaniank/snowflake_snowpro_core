The correct answer is D. They can be created to run with a caller's rights or an owner's rights. This refers to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the concept of definer's rights and invoker's rights in database security, which is crucial for controlling data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
access within stored procedures. Snowflake, like other modern database systems, supports this duality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Definer's rights (owner's rights) means the stored procedure executes with the privileges of the user who                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
owns (defined) the procedure. This provides a controlled environment where the procedure might have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
broader permissions than the user calling it, allowing for operations like updating tables that the caller                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
doesn't have direct access to. Conversely, invoker's rights (caller's rights) ensures that the procedure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
executes with the privileges of the user who calls the procedure. This offers greater security by limiting the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
procedure’s abilities to those of the caller. Snowflake stored procedures allow developers to explicitly choose

Option A is incorrect; while stored procedures can be secured, they don't inherently hide all underlying

The correct answer is C. Stored procedures in Snowflake can execute with either "owner's rights" or "caller's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
rights". When a stored procedure is created with caller's rights (using EXECUTE AS CALLER or simply                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
omitting the EXECUTE AS clause, as it's the default), it executes with the privileges of the role that called the

Option A is incorrect because preventing source code visibility is not the primary reason for using caller's

Option B describes a situation where owner's rights would likely be needed, as it implies the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
procedure needs more privileges than the caller might have. Option D is also incorrect because if the stored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
procedure needs to operate on objects that the caller doesn't have privileges for, that's precisely when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
owner's rights would be used, enabling the procedure to execute with the privileges of its owner instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Caller's rights ensure that the procedure operates within the security context established by the caller's role,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
maintaining granular access control. It's a standard security practice to limit the privileges of each

Using caller's rights minimizes unintended escalation of privileges and improves overall security

Therefore, only single quotes and double dollar signs are the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
appropriate delimiters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Using the correct delimiters is critical because Snowflake needs to be able to parse and interpret the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
JavaScript code correctly. The double dollar sign allows Snowflake to treat everything between the two dollar

Similarly, using single                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
quotes for string literals allows correct interpretation of literal data within the Javascript.

Let's break down why option B is the correct answer. Snowflake stored procedures and User-Defined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Functions (UDFs) serve distinct purposes and have different call restrictions within SQL statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Stored procedures in Snowflake are designed to execute complex procedural logic. They can contain multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
SQL statements, control flow constructs (like loops and conditionals), and can modify data within the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
database. However, a single SQL statement (the kind used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
operations) can call only one stored procedure. Think of it as embedding an entire program into a SQL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
In contrast, UDFs, whether written in SQL or another supported language, are primarily meant to return avalue or a table based on their inputs. They excel at transforming data within a query. A single SQL statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
can call multiple UDFs, often in sequence or nested fashion, to manipulate data within a single row or set of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
rows. They’re meant to be composable and applied across your data set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option A incorrectly states two stored procedures can be called; options C and D both introduce multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
stored procedure calls within a single SQL statement, which isn’t supported. Option B accurately captures the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
core call limitation: single stored procedure invocation versus multiple UDF invocations in a single SQL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
context. This difference is rooted in their design: procedures for actions, functions for transformation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
This limitation on stored procedures stems from the desire for predictable and controlled database

If multiple procedures could be invoked in a single statement, the interactions and data
