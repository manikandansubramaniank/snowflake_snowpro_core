The correct answer is C, PARSE_JSON. Snowflake's VARIANT data type is designed to store semistructured data like JSON, XML, and Avro. However, when the data is initially presented as a                                                                                                                    
string, it must be explicitly converted to a JSON-compatible format before being stored in a                                                                                                                                                                                                                
VARIANT field. The PARSE_JSON function performs this crucial conversion. It takes a string as                                                                                                                                                                                                               
input and parses it, recognizing the JSON structure and transforming it into a hierarchical data                                                                                                                                                                                                            
structure that Snowflake understands. This allows for the JSON data to be indexed, queried, and

Option A, FLATTEN, is used to unpack nested data structures, not for parsing JSON strings. It's                                                                                                                                                                                                             
employed after the JSON is parsed, when you need to extract values from arrays or objects within

Option D, TO_VARIANT,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
converts from other data types to VARIANT, but if the source is a string representing JSON, the                                                                                                                                                                                                             
conversion might not render the appropriate format for JSON manipulation. The string needs

Therefore, PARSE_JSON is the only function designed specifically for converting

Here's a detailed justification for why loading JSON data into a VARIANT column in                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake is preferable to a string column, focusing on the superiority of a VARIANT                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
column in representing data hierarchies:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
The core reason is that a VARIANT column in Snowflake natively supports semistructured data formats like JSON, Parquet, Avro, ORC, and XML. It parses and stores                                                                                                                                            
the data in its original hierarchical structure. This allows users to query specific                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
elements within the JSON document using dot notation or SQL functions, effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
navigating and extracting data from the nested structure. In contrast, a string column                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
treats the entire JSON document as a single, undifferentiated string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
While you could technically store JSON in a string column, you would lose all the

column containing JSON would require complex string manipulation functions (like

These                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
functions are inefficient and cumbersome, making it difficult to work with nested data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Moreover, you would lose the ability to leverage Snowflake's query optimization for                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
semi-structured data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Furthermore, VARIANT allows Snowflake to automatically detect the data types within

This dynamic type detection is                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
absent when storing JSON in a simple string. This is important for data that is semistructured or whose schema changes over time.                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, the key advantage of using a VARIANT column is its ability to represent the

This enables efficient querying and

While VARIANTs do compress data, they are not inherently more secure,

A. Use a SELECT statement to convert data to a VARIANT data type before inserting it.<br>B. Use the TO_VARIANT function in the INSERT statement.<br>C. Cast the data to a VARIANT data type within the INSERT statement.<br>D. Use a subquery to convert the data to a VARIANT data type and then insert it.
