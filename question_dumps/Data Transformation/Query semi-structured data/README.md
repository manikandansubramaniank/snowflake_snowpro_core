The correct answer is A.VARIANT and D.ARRAY. Snowflake natively supports querying semi-structured data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
through the VARIANT data type, which can store any type of value (including JSON, Avro, XML, etc.) without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
requiring a predefined schema. This allows for flexibility in handling diverse and evolving data structures. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
ARRAY data type is also directly supported, enabling Snowflake to store and query ordered lists of values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
within semi-structured data, crucial for hierarchical or list-based structures often found within JSON or similar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
formats. While VARCHAR can store string representations of semi-structured data, it doesn't allow for direct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
querying of the internal structure. XML, while a common semi-structured format, isn't directly a data type in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake but rather is ingested as a string and then parsed into VARIANT for manipulation. BLOB, which is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
for binary data, isn't relevant to parsing and querying semi-structured text data. Thus, the primary types

The correct statement to access the BIKEID attribute within the JSON object loaded into the data column is

Snowflake's VARIANT data type allows for semi-structured data storage, like JSON.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
To access elements within a JSON object stored as a VARIANT, you use a combination of colon (:) and dot (.)

The colon (:) is used to access keys at the top level of the variant data. In this scenario, data:BIKE accesses the

effectively returns a new variant object representing the contents of the BIKE node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Once you have access to the BIKE node, you use dot notation (.) to access nested attributes within that object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Therefore, data:BIKE.BIKEID accesses the BIKEID attribute contained inside the BIKE node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option A, select data:BIKEID, would attempt to access BIKEID directly from the top level of the JSON, which is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
incorrect. Option B, select data.BIKE.BIKEID, uses dot notation for the root level access, which is not how                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
variant access works. Option D, select data:BIKE:BIKEID, attempts to use colons to access nested attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
which is incorrect as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, select data:BIKE.BIKEID is the only statement that correctly navigates the JSON structure using

The correct method for accessing elements within a VARIANT column in Snowflake, which stores                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
semi-structured data like JSON, is to use a colon (:) followed by the element name for first-level                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
access. VARIANT columns encapsulate data that can have a nested structure, but direct access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
using a single colon is designated for immediate children of the VARIANT. This allows querying a

Option C uses a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
double colon (::), which is used for type casting in Snowflake, not for accessing elements within                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
VARIANT. It’s critical to distinguish between accessing data elements in semi-structured form                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
and type casting. Snowflake’s query engine is designed to handle this with its specific syntax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Therefore, using a single colon is the accurate and recommended method for the first level of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
semi-structured data navigation. This simplifies querying and data extraction from complex data

Snowflake’s flexibility in dealing with semi-structured data using this syntax is a key

The ability to access parts of JSON structures stored in a VARIANT column is crucial for

A JSON document is stored in the source_column of type VARIANT. The document has an array called elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The array contains the name key that has a string value.

The correct answer is D. source_column:elements[0].name. Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Snowflake's VARIANT data type is designed to handle semi-structured data like JSON. To access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
elements within a VARIANT, you use a combination of colon notation (:) and bracket notation ([]).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The colon notation is used to access keys within a JSON object, and bracket notation, with a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
numerical index, is used to access elements within a JSON array. JSON arrays are zero-indexed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
meaning the first element is at index 0, not 1. Therefore, to get the first element of the elements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
array, we use elements[0].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The name key is then accessed using the colon notation again because it's a key within the JSON                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
object that represents the first element of the array. Combining these accessors, the correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
syntax to extract the name from the first element becomes source_column:elements[0].name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The expression first accesses the source_column, then uses the colon to look for the key                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
elements. It then uses [0] to access the first array element and another colon to access the key

keys in the variant type data. Option C is incorrect because the array indexing is incorrect (it uses

It's widely used in big data ecosystems and integrates well with other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
analytics tools. Option D, Newline Delimited JSON, is also a supported format. Each line in the file

JSON entries. Although JSON itself isn't ideal for extremely large datasets, newline-delimited                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
JSON can be suitable for practical scenarios. In contrast, Option A, Binary file in Avro, while used

Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
C, Comma-separated JSON, is not a practical output format since comma-separated values are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
geared towards relational data, not the complexity of nested JSON. Finally, Option E, Plain text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
file containing XML elements, isn’t directly supported for unloading. Snowflake doesn’t maintain

Therefore, Parquet (B) and Newline Delimited                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
JSON (D) are the two correct choices for exporting semi-structured data from Snowflake.

The correct answer is D: The column name is case-insensitive, but element names are casesensitive. When querying semi-structured data in Snowflake, such as JSON, Parquet, or Avro files,                                                                                                                                                                             
the top-level column name that contains the semi-structured data is treated as case-insensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
This means that my_json_column, My_JSON_column, and MY_JSON_COLUMN all refer to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
same column. This aligns with Snowflake's standard behavior for table and column identifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
However, once you start navigating the hierarchy within the semi-structured data, accessing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
individual elements using bracket or dot notation, the element names are treated as casesensitive. For example, json_column:key1 is different from json_column:Key1. Snowflake uses                                                                                                                                                                                   
case-sensitive comparisons to match exact element names within the nested structures. This is

for better readability and enables the processing of data with specific case-sensitive field naming

Failing to consider this can lead to

Option B and Option C use the correct syntax for accessing the "phone number" field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Double quotes around the field name handle the space correctly, and both the use of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
uppercase (SRC) and lowercase (src) for the alias are valid, considering SQL is caseinsensitive for keywords and aliases.

Both refer to the column src (or SRC) → key 'customer' → key 'email'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Column names in Snowflake are case-insensitive by default, so SRC and src are the

JSON keys (customer and email) are written in lowercase in both D and E, so they match
