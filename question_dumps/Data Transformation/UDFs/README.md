The correct answer is JavaScript and SQL. Snowflake supports User-Defined Functions (UDFs) written in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
JavaScript and SQL. JavaScript UDFs allow for more complex procedural logic and data manipulation,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
enabling developers to extend Snowflake's functionality beyond standard SQL operations. These are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
particularly useful when intricate transformations or calculations are needed that are difficult or inefficient to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
express using SQL alone. SQL UDFs, on the other hand, provide a way to encapsulate and reuse SQL code,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
improving query readability and maintainability. They are well-suited for simple functions like date formatting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
or simple calculations. While Java and Python are commonly used languages in cloud computing

External functions integrate with services like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions or Google Cloud

Crucially, Snowflake allows UDF creation using JavaScript, primarily for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
procedural logic and data manipulation within the database environment. This means developers can embed

User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Snowflake enables developers to extend its built-in functionality by creating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
custom functions using these languages, which are executed within the Snowflake environment. This allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
for more complex data transformations and calculations to be performed directly within the database, withoutneeding to transfer data to external applications. JavaScript UDFs are particularly useful for handling semistructured data like JSON, and Python's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of analytical tasks,

The correct answer is B.

Tabular User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in Snowflake are designed to return a result set consisting of multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
rows and columns, effectively a table-like structure. This is in contrast to scalar UDFs that return a single                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
value. To signify that a UDF will return a table, the RETURNS clause in its definition must specify the TABLE

partition or result set, not to define a tabular UDFâ€™s return type. The TABULAR keyword is not a recognized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
syntax for specifying a table-returning function in Snowflake. VALUES is used for constructing a result set by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
explicitly specifying values, typically within SQL queries, and isn't the correct keyword for defining the return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
type of a UDF that returns a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
In essence, the TABLE keyword in the RETURNS clause is the crucial identifier that distinguishes tabular

This feature is common in many programming languages and database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option A is incorrect because overloading requires differences in arguments, not just same number of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
arguments. Option B is also incorrect; overloaded UDFs are distinguished by their arguments, even if                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
argument types are similar. Option D is incorrect as it describes UDFs with different names, which is not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
overloading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake uses the function's signature, which includes the function name and the number and types of its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
arguments, to resolve the correct UDF to call. This allows you to have several UDFs with the same purpose or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
functionality that can handle different types of input data. For instance, you might have an add UDF that can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
add two integers, and another add UDF that can add two floating-point numbers, and even another for adding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
strings for concatenation. This is enabled by the signature distinction. This adds flexibility and reduces the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
need to create a separate UDF for each input type variant. The function called during a query is the one whose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
signature exactly matches the arguments provided.
