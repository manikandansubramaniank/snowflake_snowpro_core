Let's break down why option B is the correct answer regarding Snowflake tasks. Snowflake tasks are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
designed for automated execution of SQL code, and their functionality centers around scheduled runs. Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
B accurately reflects this, stating that a task executes a single SQL statement or command on a predefined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
schedule. This core capability of scheduled, automated execution is the fundamental purpose of Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
tasks. Option A is incorrect because while tasks execute SQL, they aren’t invoked with a CALL statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Instead, their execution is driven by their defined schedule. Option C is partially correct, as tasks execute SQL,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
but they are limited to a single SQL statement/command within their definition, not a set. If you need to run aseries of SQL statements, you would need to employ procedures or a combination of tasks. Option D is also                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
incorrect because SELECT statements are for data retrieval, not for invoking the execution of a task.

execute a task, Snowflake's scheduling engine takes over when the schedule triggers based on a provided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
cron expression. The primary goal of Snowflake tasks is to enable automation of data processing or loading

A. Include the SQL statements in the body of the task CREATE TASK mytask .. AS INSERT INTO target1 SELECT<br>B. A stored procedure can have only one DML statement per stored procedure invocation and therefore the user<br>C. Use a stored procedure executing multiple SQL statements and invoke the stored procedure from the task.<br>D. Create a task for each SQL statement (e.g. resulting in task1, task2, etc.) and string the series of SQL
