The correct answer is D, HyperLogLog (HLL). Estimating distinct counts in massive datasets like tables with                                                                                                                 
trillions of rows presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods like COUNT(DISTINCT) become                                                                                                                         
computationally expensive and time-consuming, potentially impacting query performance and resource                                                                                                                          
utilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
HLL addresses this challenge by employing a probabilistic data structure designed for approximating the                                                                                                                     
number of distinct elements in a set. It achieves this approximation with a minimal memory footprint, making ithighly scalable for large datasets. Instead of storing the actual values, HLL algorithms maintain statistical
summaries based on observed patterns in the data.                                                                                                                                                                           
MD5 (A) is a cryptographic hash function useful for data integrity and generating unique identifiers but                                                                                                                    
doesn't directly estimate distinct counts. Window functions (B) perform calculations across a set of table rows                                                                                                             
that are related to the current row. They are not designed for distinct count estimation. External functions (C)                                                                                                            
allow Snowflake to call code that runs outside of Snowflake, but they do not natively perform distinct count                                                                                                                
estimation; you would still need an efficient algorithm within the external function.                                                                                                                                       
HLL algorithms, on the other hand, specifically target this problem. They offer a good trade-off between                                                                                                                    
accuracy and efficiency, providing estimates that are generally accurate within a small margin of error                                                                                                                     
(typically less than 1%). Snowflake provides native HLL functions to take advantage of this efficient                                                                                                                       
methodology. They operate by converting the raw data into a memory-efficient HLL representation and                                                                                                                         
aggregating those representations efficiently. These functions allow users to analyze massive amounts of

for counting distinct values in very large tables, HLL functions are the best choice compared to other
