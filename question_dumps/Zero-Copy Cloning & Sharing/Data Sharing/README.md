Snowflake's data sharing model is designed to be cost-effective and encourage data sharing.

incur costs primarily based on the compute resources they use for data processing, storage, and services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
However, creating a share itself is not an activity that triggers additional charges. The costs are borne by the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
data consumer when they query the shared data, not the data provider for making the share available.Snowflake's cost model emphasizes consumption-based billing for compute and storage, ensuring providers

The statement is False. Snowflake's Secure Data Sharing functionality allows Data Providers to share data

Data sharing in Snowflake is not a point-to-point relationship; instead, a Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Provider creates a "share" object and grants access to it for any number of authorized accounts. These                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
accounts, acting as Data Consumers, can then access the data without requiring copies or data movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The share itself is a virtual construct, providing a live, read-only view of the provider's data. There are no limits

A. There is no need to have a Snowflake account in the target region, a share will be created for each user.<br>B. The listing is replicated into all selected regions automatically, the data is not.<br>C. The user must have the ORGADMIN role available in at least one account to link accounts for replication.<br>D. Shares attached to listings in remote regions can be viewed from any account in an organization.<br>E. For a standard listing the user can wait until the first customer requests the data before replicating it to the

This split between metadata and data is a core aspect of Snowflake's data sharing model and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
enhances efficiency by only transferring the necessary data when required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option E says, "For a standard listing the user can wait until the first customer requests the data before                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
replicating it to the target region." This reflects Snowflake's data replication behavior. You aren't compelled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
to upfront replicate your datasets in every region where you make a listing accessible.

process can be initiated on demand, i.e., when a customer from a different region subscribes. This allows for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
better cost management as you’re only moving data when a specific need arises rather than replicating it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
speculatively. This "lazy" or on-demand replication approach is a good practice for cost optimization and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
resource efficiency in a multi-region cloud environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option A is incorrect, a consumer must have a snowflake account in the region to consume a share. Option C is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
incorrect because while ORGADMIN is needed for some org-wide operations like setting up replication, it’s not

This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
flexibility is a key aspect of Snowflake's data sharing architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option E: The Data Consumer pays only for compute resources to query the shared data.

accurately reflects Snowflake's data sharing cost model. The data consumer pays for the compute resources                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
used when querying the shared data. The data provider is not charged for compute resources used by the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
consumer when querying shared data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option A: The Data Consumer pays for data storage as well as for data computing. The data consumer does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
not pay for the data storage. The data provider pays for the storage of the data being shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option B: The shared data is copied into the Data Consumer account, so the Consumer can modify it without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
impacting the base data of the Provider. Data sharing in Snowflake does not involve copying data. Instead, it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
grants direct, secure access to the data in the provider's account. The consumer queries the data in place, so                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
they don't need to copy it into their account. It's a live, read-only view of the data, so the consumer can't

Option D: The Provider is charged for compute resources used by the Data Consumer to query the shared

provider does not incur these costs. This is a fundamental aspect of Snowflake's data sharing model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Here's why Snowflake's approach is beneficial:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
No data duplication: Avoids the costs and complexities of copying data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Real-time access: Consumers always have access to the latest version of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Simplified management: Providers maintain control over their data and can easily revoke access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Cost-effective: Consumers only pay for the compute resources they use.

Only specific object types are designed to participate in this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
secure sharing model. Tables (D) are fundamental objects that hold data, and therefore are directly sharable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The core concept of data sharing relies on granting access to tables so consumers can query the data within

This allows the sharing of complex logic and computation within the data sharing relationship

A. If an account is enrolled with a Data Exchange, it will lose its access to the Snowflake Marketplace.<br>B. A Data Exchange allows groups of accounts to share data privately among the accounts.<br>C. A Data Exchange allows accounts to share data with third, non-Snowflake parties.<br>D. Data Exchange functionality is available by default in accounts using the Enterprise edition or higher.<br>E. The sharing of data in a Data Exchange is bidirectional.

D. Data Exchange functionality is available by default in accounts using the Enterprise edition or higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
This is incorrect.

A. The object immediately becomes unavailable for all Data Consumers.<br>B. Any additional data arriving after this point in time will not be visible to Data Consumers.<br>C. The Data Consumers stop seeing data updates and become responsible for storage charges for the object.<br>D. A static copy of the object at the time the privilege was revoked is created in the Data Consumers account.

provider revokes privileges, they are essentially removing the consumer's access to that metadata, rendering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
the underlying data inaccessible. There is no lag time or grace period, and the data doesn't get copied

Option B is incorrect because the data is completely inaccessible, not just updates. Option C is wrong as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
consumers never become responsible for the source's storage charges since there are no copies created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option D is incorrect as no static copy is made when the privileges are revoked. Since data is not physically

The consumer does not take on

External tables, which point to data stored in external locations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
like cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage), can be shared. This allows

copy of the data. Snowflake handles authorization and access control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Masking policies (A) are security policies applied to columns, not directly shareable database objects. While                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
masking policies can impact what is viewed in a shared view or table, the policy itself cannot be shared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
directly. Stored procedures (B), which contain executable code, are not shared through secure data sharing;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
they are deployed and executed within a Snowflake account. Tasks (C), which schedule SQL statements or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
stored procedures, are also not shareable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The primary purpose of Snowflake's secure data sharing is to provide controlled access to data, and external                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
tables perfectly fit this model by abstracting away the storage details while still allowing direct querying

Sharing other objects like masking policies, stored procedures, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
tasks would introduce security and operational challenges, therefore those are not supported by data sharing.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they suggest direct,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
cross-cloud sharing capabilities that don't exist. Option A mistakenly assumes shares can directly cross

Okay, let's break down why options C and D are the correct answers regarding Snowflake data sharing, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
why the others are incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Option C is Correct: Reader Accounts are indeed created by Data Providers. In Snowflake's data sharing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
model, the provider is the entity that owns the data and wants to share it. They have the authority to establish                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Reader Accounts, which are special Snowflake accounts designed for data consumption, granting users                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
within them access to the shared data. The provider manages these accounts and their access permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option D is Correct: Shared databases in Snowflake are inherently read-only for the data consumer. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
design ensures data integrity and prevents unintended modifications by consumers. The consumer can query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
and analyze the data but cannot alter it. This read-only access is a critical aspect of Snowflake's secure and

Option A is Incorrect: When a Data Provider creates new objects (like tables or views) within a shared

accounts, which requires this elevated permission level to control and manage inter-account data sharing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Specifically, creating a share necessitates the ability to define the data being shared and configure how that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
data is accessed by recipient accounts. This includes granting permissions on the objects being shared, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
is an account-level administrative task. The other roles lack the sufficient privileges required for thisoperation. The ORGADMIN role is for managing the entire Snowflake organization, not a single account. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
SECURITYADMIN role focuses on security-related tasks within an account, but does not encompass crossaccount sharing management. Lastly, while SHAREADMIN might seem logical, it is not a default role and does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
not grant the necessary permissions for creating new shares; SHAREADMIN is typically granted to users or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
roles to administer existing shares, not to create new ones. Therefore, the creation of a share requires the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
global management capabilities of the ACCOUNTADMIN role. This ensures that data sharing is controlled by

For suppliers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
within the same cloud region as the provider, a direct data share is ideal. However, for suppliers in different                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
cloud regions, a replicated proxy share becomes essential. A replicated proxy share creates a copy of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
data share in the supplier's region, minimizing latency and avoiding cross-region data transfer costs during                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
query execution. This ensures optimal performance and data locality for all suppliers, regardless of their                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
geographical location. Snowflake manages the replication process, simplifying the administrative overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Why other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
B. Deploy a single reader account to be shared by all of the non-Snowflake suppliers: This is a security risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Sharing a single reader account exposes the data to unauthorized access if the credentials are compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Furthermore, it's difficult to audit access and usage patterns of individual suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
C. Create an ETL pipeline that uses select and inserts statements from the source to the target supplier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
accounts: This involves building and maintaining a complex ETL pipeline, which is more costly and timeconsuming than using Snowflake's built-in data sharing capabilities. It also duplicates the data, increasing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
storage costs and potentially introducing inconsistencies. Additionally, it bypasses Snowflake's built-in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
security and governance features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
E. Extract the shared transactional data to an external stage and use cloud storage utilities to reload the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
suppliers' regions: While this approach could technically work, it's inefficient, complex, and insecure. It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
requires constantly exporting and reloading the data, which can lead to data latency and inconsistencies.

Snowflake, are core to data sharing. These hold the actual data that consumers need. Secure views, which are

Secure views allow for data masking and other security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
implementations while still allowing shared access, providing a secure layer on top of data. Views are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
shareable, but standard views do not contain data and thus not ideal objects for a share. Streams track data

When dealing with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
unstructured data (files in stages), direct access needs to be managed differently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL generates a scoped URL that grants temporary, read-only access to a specific file

The scope limits the access only to files intended to be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
accessible through the secure view, enhancing data governance. This approach aligns with the principle of

GET_PRESIGNED_URL, on the other hand, creates a pre-signed URL to access a file. This URL includes an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
authorization signature, giving temporary access to a resource hosted in a stage. Unlike scoped URLs, presigned URLs are not tied to the view context directly but rely on the specific user permissions and policies

Both ensure that only authorized users can access the unstructured data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
BUILD_STAGE_FILE_URL, GET_ABSOLUTE_PATH, and GET_RELATIVE_PATH are not suited for this

GET_ABSOLUTE_PATH and GET_RELATIVE_PATH functions return the file paths but do not provide a means

Here's a detailed justification for why the correct answer is B.

Snowflake facilitates data sharing without requiring data duplication using its secure data sharing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
capabilities. Secure views are the primary mechanism to achieve this. They act as logical pointers to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
underlying data in a source database. This approach avoids the need to copy or transfer data physically, thus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
optimizing storage and management overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
When a data provider wants to share data, they create a secure view within their database that queries the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
specific data they want to share. This view is then granted access to a specific share. The share can then be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
granted to other Snowflake accounts. The consumer account then uses a database created from the share                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and queries the shared data through the secure view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Crucially, the consumer account does not gain direct access to the provider's underlying tables. Instead, they

Data sharing in Snowflake facilitates secure and efficient data transfer between accounts without requiring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
data duplication. Option B leverages this core functionality. A data share is a named object that encapsulates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
access to specific database objects (tables, views, etc.) in the provider (production) account. The provider                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
grants access to a consumer (non-production) account by sharing the data share. The consumer account can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
then create databases or schemas from the share as read-only objects, meaning no data is copied; rather, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
non-production account accesses the data directly in place. This avoids storage overheads, ensures data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
consistency, and allows for near-real-time access to data. This method is simple, highly efficient, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
specifically designed for scenarios where data needs to be transferred across Snowflake accounts.Option A, cloning, would create a complete copy of the data in the non-production account, leading to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
increased storage costs, potential data synchronization challenges, and requiring more time to execute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option C, subscription, refers to features that are more associated with stream data which is not ideal for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
historical data and would create a stream of data rather than a static copy or reference, creating additional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
overhead. Option D, a reader account, is primarily used to provide external parties with access to your data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
which isn't the use case mentioned of sharing across accounts that are both under your control.

as described in option B, is optimized for this specific purpose within the Snowflake ecosystem.

When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake creates a pre-signed URL, it embeds temporary credentials within the URL itself. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
anyone with the pre-signed URL can access the specified file without needing to authenticate with Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
or the underlying cloud provider directly. This contrasts with other URL types. File URLs, scoped URLs, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
scoped file URLs typically require authentication and authorization using Snowflake credentials or a session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
context. These URLs rely on Snowflake’s internal access controls. A file URL often refers to a location internal

shared through shares, data shares can also share tables directly, without requiring a view as the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
intermediary. The ability to share views is just one capability of a share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option D, “Data shares are cloud agnostic and can cross regions by default,” is incorrect. Snowflake data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
shares are not inherently cloud-agnostic and are tied to the specific Snowflake region the provider is using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Data sharing across clouds or regions requires explicit configuration (through replication, for instance).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Therefore, the core characteristic of a data share is that it facilitates secure, read-only access to data without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
physical copies, meaning A is not correct. The most accurate understanding is that a data share grants access

It’s important to note that in the original response, the answer was incorrectly labeled as A.

This restriction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
stems from the fact that standard views expose the underlying query logic to the consumer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
account. Sharing a standard view would reveal the structure of the base tables, the specific data

compromising sensitive information. Snowflake addresses this by offering secure views and

accessing the detailed logic. These secure objects can be shared safely, as the consumer only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
sees the results of the view without visibility into the internal workings. In contrast, standard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
views are not designed with this security layer, making them inappropriate for direct sharing

The limitation encourages a practice of sharing data through secure methods,

The correct answer is A. Data providers are the entities that host and share data within Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Data providers own the data and determine how it's accessed and shared with other Snowflake

They utilize secure data sharing features of Snowflake, granting controlled access to

Snowflake's data sharing feature enables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
secure and efficient data distribution without the need for physical data movement.

Provider account, in this context, is the Snowflake account that holds the data intended for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
sharing. When sharing with a consumer who does not have a Snowflake account, the Data Provider                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
uses a feature called Reader Accounts. Reader Accounts are special Snowflake accounts created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
and managed by the Data Provider. These accounts are designed specifically for consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
without their own Snowflake infrastructure, granting them limited access only to the shared data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The Data Provider bears the responsibility of managing the Reader Account and its associated

Data Consumers, by definition, are Snowflake accounts receiving shared data, hence this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
option is incorrect when the consumer doesn't have one. An Organization represents a higherlevel container of accounts, not a type for data sharing itself. Therefore, the Data Provider

these can be used within queries and views that are shared, the external table object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
itself isn't shared as a distinct entity. Finally, User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
(option E) are code-based functions that, while they can be part of shared schemas and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
may operate on shared tables, aren't themselves a type of table that can be directly

Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Snowsight's cross-cloud auto-fulfillment for listings leverages the understanding that a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
private listing is a deliberate sharing between specific Snowflake accounts. This preexisting relationship makes it less ambiguous and allows for the system to infer that
