quick provisioning of Dev/Test/QA environments, data backups, and point-in-time snapshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
A. Quick provisioning of Dev and Test/QA environments: Zero-copy cloning allows the creation of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
independent copies of data without duplicating the underlying storage. This is invaluable for creating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
development, testing, and QA environments rapidly. Developers and testers can work on cloned data without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
affecting production data, accelerating the development cycle. This approach significantly reduces the time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
and cost associated with traditional data copying methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
B. Data backups: While not a complete replacement for traditional backup strategies, zero-copy clones can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
serve as a form of immediate data backup. If a table or database is accidentally modified or corrupted, a clone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
from a previous point in time can be quickly restored, providing a means to recover data without extensive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
downtime. This approach provides near-instant recovery capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
C. Point-in-time snapshots: Zero-copy cloning allows creating snapshots of data at specific points in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
These snapshots can be used for auditing, compliance, or historical analysis. Since clones initially consume no                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
additional storage, taking regular snapshots is cost-effective and provides a historical record of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Users can easily revert to a specific point in time if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
D. Performance optimization: Although cloning can impact performance if heavily modified after creation due                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
to copy-on-write behavior, it's not considered a primary use case for the feature. Instead, consider using query

Zero-copy cloning in Snowflake is a metadata-only operation. When you clone a table, schema, or database,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
you are not physically copying the underlying data files (micro-partitions). Instead, a new object is created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
that points to the existing data. Initially, both the source and the clone share the same micro-partitions. At the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
precise moment the clone is created, both the original object and the clone have full access to the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
physical data. Any changes made to either the original or the clone after that point will result in new micropartitions being created for that specific object, and thus data will diverge.                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option A is incorrect because zero-copy cloning is designed to minimize storage costs by avoiding duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option B is incorrect; while objects generally inherit privileges from their parent, these are not automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and fully inherited in every case and the cloning operation does not guarantee inheritance of all permissions.

The correct answer is D. All micro-partitions between the original and cloned tables are fully shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Zero-copy cloning in Snowflake is a metadata operation, not a full data copy. When a table (or other object) is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
cloned, Snowflake creates a new, logically independent object that initially shares all the underlying micropartitions of the original object. This sharing significantly reduces storage costs and avoids the time                                                                                                                                                           
associated with copying large datasets. Because data isn't duplicated, storage costs don't increase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
immediately (as stated in option A). The clone doesn't include the original's load history (option B is incorrect).
