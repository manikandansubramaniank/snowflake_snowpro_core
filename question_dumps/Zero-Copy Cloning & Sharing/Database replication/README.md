Here's a detailed justification for why options C and D are the correct answers when a cloned table is                                                                                                                                                                  
replicated to a secondary database in Snowflake:                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
When a table is cloned in Snowflake, it initially shares the underlying storage with the original table. This is                                                                                                                                                        
achieved through metadata pointers, meaning no additional physical storage is used initially. However,                                                                                                                                                                  
replicating this cloned table to a secondary database introduces a new dynamic. Replication involves                                                                                                                                                                    
physically copying the data to the secondary region. This means that while the clone initially only had                                                                                                                                                                 
metadata pointers, when it's replicated, the actual physical data associated with the cloned table needs to be                                                                                                                                                          
copied and stored in the secondary database. Hence, option C, "The physical data is replicated," is correct.                                                                                                                                                            
Since physical data is copied to a new location, this requires storage resources in the secondary account. This                                                                                                                                                         
physical storage incurs costs, therefore option D, "Additional costs for storage are charged to a secondary

own storage and compute resources. The replication process, thus, leads to the secondary account being

Option A is incorrect because, while the cloned table is a snapshot in time, the replicated table in the

of cloned tables is a supported feature in Snowflake, meaning the operation will be successful. Option E is                                                                                                                                                             
partially true in that metadata is involved, but the main outcome of the replication is physical data replication,

The correct answer is A and D. Replication in Snowflake provides significant benefits for business continuity                                                                                                                                                           
and disaster recovery scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A. Disaster recovery: Replication enables you to create a secondary copy of your data in a different region or                                                                                                                                                          
account. In the event of a regional outage or disaster affecting the primary location, you can failover to the                                                                                                                                                          
replicated copy, minimizing downtime and data loss. This ensures business continuity and allows users to                                                                                                                                                                
continue accessing and using data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
D. Database failover and failback: Replication facilitates the process of failing over to a secondary database                                                                                                                                                          
in case of an issue with the primary. Snowflake supports both database replication and replication of groupsof databases. This allows for faster recovery times as compared to rebuilding a database from scratch. After                                                
the primary is restored, Snowflake also supports failback, allowing you to return operations to the original                                                                                                                                                            
environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
B. Time Travel: Time Travel allows you to access historical data within a defined period (up to 90 days for                                                                                                                                                             
Enterprise Edition and higher). While valuable for data recovery and auditing, it's not directly related to                                                                                                                                                             
replication and disaster recovery across regions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
C. Fail-safe: Fail-safe provides a 7-day period after Time Travel for Snowflake to recover data in the event of a                                                                                                                                                       
catastrophic system failure. It's a safety net managed by Snowflake and not directly controlled by the user                                                                                                                                                             
like replication, which offers region-level redundancy. It's also not a user-initiated process like failover.                                                                                                                                                           
E. Data security: While replication indirectly contributes to data security by providing a backup in case of data                                                                                                                                                       
loss or corruption, its primary focus isn't on preventing data breaches or unauthorized access. Snowflake                                                                                                                                                               
provides various security features, such as encryption, access control, and network policies, that directly

The correct answer is A. Pipes. Both database replication and replication groups in                                                                                                                                                                                     
Snowflake support the replication of Pipes. Pipes are Snowflake objects that automate                                                                                                                                                                                   
the loading of data into tables from external or internal locations. Database replication                                                                                                                                                                               
replicates a single database to a target account, including its contained objects.                                                                                                                                                                                      
Replication groups, on the other hand, provide a more granular and flexible approach to                                                                                                                                                                                 
replicating multiple databases and their specific objects across accounts or regions.Pipes, being essential for data ingestion workflows, are crucial objects to replicate in
