The statement is False. Snowflake's data sharing mechanism is designed with a focus on security and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
controlled access. When a data provider shares data with a data consumer, the consumer receives read-only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
access to the shared database or objects. This access is granted directly by the provider. The data consumer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
does not inherit any ownership or administrative privileges over the shared data. Consequently, the consumer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
cannot further propagate or 're-share' the received data to other consumers. This design decision prevents

The original data provider must explicitly grant access to additional consumers, thus maintaining

Allowing re-sharing would create significant security risks

The shared data is virtualized and no actual data copying occurs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
when a share is established; therefore the consumer does not "own" a copy.

Reader accounts in Snowflake are specifically designed to grant access to shared data without requiring the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
consumer to have a full Snowflake account. These accounts operate under a provider's Snowflake instance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
and rely on data shares, which are the mechanism for securely sharing database objects across accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
When a provider shares data through a share, a reader account can access the shared data objects (tables,

While the reader account itself doesn't possess independent storage or compute resources, it's able

D. Data is available without copying or moving. A key benefit of the Data Marketplace is the "zero-copy"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
architecture. When you subscribe to a data product, the data provider shares data directly into your                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Snowflake account via secure data sharing. You don't need to copy or move the data, which eliminates storage

Why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
B. Data needs to be loaded into a cloud provider as a consumer account. This is incorrect.

E. Data transformations are required when combining Data Marketplace datasets with existing data in

account is made available to the consumer account through the database created from the share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
This means that the "shared objects" (tables, views, etc.) within the database in the consumer account areessentially pointers to the actual data, which remains physically located and managed within the provider

The consumer account can then query and use these shared objects as if they were local, but any                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
modifications or data storage still occur within the provider's environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Therefore, the shared objects don't get "transferred" (A) or "copied" (B). The consumer account doesn't own                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
the underlying data; it only has read-only access (typically). They can access it using the compute resources in

The ability to re-share (D) depends on whether the provider has explicitly granted that

what happens is that the shared objects become accessible.

reader account when querying the shared data. This is because the compute resources (the warehouse) usedby the reader account reside within and are managed by the provider's Snowflake account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
C. The reader account can clone data the provider has shared, but cannot re-share it. Reader accounts do

The correct answer is D.

Their primary purpose is to allow consumers to query data without being able to modify it or

Specifically, the CREATE SHARE command is prohibited because it is used to create a new share object in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Snowflake. Shares are fundamental to the data sharing process; they define which databases and objects are

Allowing a reader account to create shares would violate the security model

DROP ROLE allows for managing role hierarchy inside reader account, and SHOW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
SCHEMAS allows the user to explore the available schemas they have access to. DESCRIBE TABLE allows

A. Worksheets can be shared with users that are internal or external to any organization.<br>B. To run a shared worksheet, a user must be granted the role used for the worksheet session context.<br>C. Snowsight allows users to view and refresh results but not to edit shared worksheets.<br>D. Snowsight offers different sharing permissions at the worksheet, folder, and dashboard level.

Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
When a worksheet is shared in Snowsight, the recipient gains access to the content of the worksheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
However, they don't automatically inherit the execution privileges associated with the original author's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
session. This is a critical security feature in cloud environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Think of it like this: the worksheet is the recipe, and the role used in the session is the chef. Sharing the recipedoesn't make someone else a chef.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
For the recipient to successfully execute the worksheet and interact with the underlying data, they need to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
possess the necessary privileges. This means they need to be granted the same role that was used during the

This role determines which databases, schemas, and tables the worksheet can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
access. Without the correct role, the user will encounter authorization errors when trying to run queries within

Option A is incorrect because worksheet sharing is generally confined to users within the same Snowflake

Sharing across organizations isn't directly supported through the standard worksheet sharing

Option C is incorrect because Snowsight allows sharing with different permissions levels. The owner of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
worksheet can decide whether the shared user can only view or edit as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option D is incorrect as sharing is only supported at the worksheet level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, ensuring that the recipient has the correct role is crucial for successful collaboration and data

The correct answer is B. Create a reader account and create a share of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Here's why: Snowflake's secure data sharing capabilities are designed to facilitate controlled access to data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
across different accounts. When sharing data with someone who doesn't have a Snowflake account, direct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
access through standard Snowflake user credentials isn't possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option B addresses this by leveraging reader accounts. A reader account is a special type of Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
account that allows external users, without a full Snowflake deployment, to access data shared with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
You create a reader account, which is associated with your own Snowflake account. Then, you establish a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
share, granting specific access to databases, schemas, and tables within your account to this reader account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The recipient is provided with connection details to this reader account. They can then query and utilize the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
shared data without having to set up their own independent Snowflake environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option A, using User-Defined Functions (UDFs), doesn't enable data sharing in this context; UDFs are for

Option D, moving the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
account to another region, is irrelevant to data sharing with external users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, using a reader account and creating a share is the appropriate method for securely allowing a nonSnowflake user to consume data within the platform.

A. The DATA_RETENTION_IT parameter in the consumer account is set to 0.<br>B. The consumer account runs the GRANT INPORTED PRIVILEGES command on the data share every 24 hours.<br>C. The objects in the data share are being deleted and the grant pattern is not re-applied systematically.<br>D. The consumer account acquires the data share through a private data exchange.

The correct answer is C: The objects in the data share are being deleted and the grant pattern is not reapplied systematically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Let's break down why this is the case: Data sharing in Snowflake relies on metadata pointers referencing the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
producer's data. When the producer deletes underlying objects (tables, views, etc.) and does not

consumer's data share becomes unavailable to query that deleted/inaccessible data.

The correct answer is C. Scoped URL. Snowflake strongly recommends using scoped URLs when sharing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
unstructured data via shares. Scoped URLs offer enhanced security and control compared to pre-signed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
URLs. Unlike pre-signed URLs, scoped URLs are tied directly to the specific share and the consumer account,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
limiting access to only the intended recipient. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a URL is

A. It can be used by a client that does not have a Snowflake account<br>B. It is read-only and prevents the shared data from being updated by the provider.<br>C. It can be connected to a Snowflake account in a different region.<br>D.

They eliminate the need for recipients to set up their own full Snowflake deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option A, using the Snowflake Marketplace, is incorrect because it’s designed for broader data monetization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
and discovery, typically involving commercial transactions, rather than simple data sharing with known                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
entities lacking accounts. Option C, creating a consumer account, is similarly incorrect. Consumer accounts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
are still full Snowflake accounts, just one side of a data sharing relationship, where the recipient has to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
manage their own compute and storage costs. These do not circumvent the recipient needing a Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
account. Lastly, Option D, using a Snowflake share, is a component of the correct solution and is not sufficient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
alone. A Snowflake share is a named object that specifies the objects to share (tables, views, etc) and is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
as a source of data for accounts. However, to use a share, a user must have a Snowflake account. A reader                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
account is created, and then granted permissions to the share to make it useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, the reader account mechanism directly addresses the scenario described in the question by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
providing a controlled, read-only access point for users without a dedicated Snowflake environment. It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
facilitates secure and cost-effective data sharing without the complexities of managing multiple Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
accounts. The provider retains control over the data and can easily manage the access permissions granted to

The correct answer is C: alter share my_share add accounts = xy12345;. This command correctly adds the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
specified account (xy12345) to the list of accounts that have access to the share my_share.

sharing is managed through share objects. These objects act as containers defining what data is shared.

grant access to a share, you must explicitly specify which accounts can consume the shared data. The ALTER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
SHARE command with the ADD ACCOUNTS clause is the designated method for this purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Option A, grant usage on share my_share to account xy12345;, is incorrect because it uses a GRANT statement,

Option B, grant select on share my_share to account xy12345;, is also incorrect for similar reasons,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
focusing on privileges rather than account association. Option D, alter account xy12345 add share my_share;, is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
incorrect because the share is modified, not the consumer account. Modifying the consumer account isn’t how                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake data sharing works. The account receiving the share has no mechanism to ‘add’ a share to itself; it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
has to be explicitly granted access. The account receiving the share (the consumer) does not need to add or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
be modified in order to receive a share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Therefore, only the ALTER SHARE command with the ADD ACCOUNTS clause achieves the required goal of

A. The DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter in the consumer account is set to 0.<br>B. The consumer account runs the GRANT INPORTED PRIVILEGES command on the data share every 24 hours.<br>C.
