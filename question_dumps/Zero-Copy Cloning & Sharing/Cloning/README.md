The correct answer is ABCE, meaning Tables, Named File Formats, Schemas, and Databases can be cloned inSnowflake. Cloning in Snowflake creates a point-in-time copy of an object without physically duplicating the                                                                                                                     
underlying data, initially. This functionality leverages Snowflake's metadata and zero-copy cloning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
capabilities. Tables, being a fundamental data storage structure, can be cloned, resulting in a new table with                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
the same data structure and, initially, the same data. Named File Formats, which define the structure of data                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
in files, can also be cloned, allowing for consistent data import and export processes. Schemas, logical                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
groupings of database objects, are also clonable. A cloned schema contains clones of all its objects as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Finally, entire databases can be cloned, creating a complete point-in-time replica, which is extremely useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
for development, testing, and disaster recovery purposes. The cloning process is extremely efficient due to                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
metadata usage and copy-on-write mechanisms where only changes are physically stored. Shares are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
cloned, instead, one may modify shares but clone operations wouldn't be applicable as shares manage access

Cloning Users                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
can lead to security complexities, and security roles are the preferred method for managing access control

The correct answer is B. Existing child objects within the database and D. Privileges on the schemas within                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
the database. When a database is cloned in Snowflake, it creates an exact, point-in-time copy of the source                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
database. This clone includes all existing objects within the database at the time of cloning, such as schemas,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
tables, views, and other database objects. Therefore, option B is correct. However, while database-level                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
privileges are not directly inherited, privileges specifically granted on schemas within the database are                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
cloned. This means that if a user has been granted specific permissions on a schema within the original                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
database, those permissions will also be applied to the cloned schema within the cloned database. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
validates option D. Privileges on the database itself (option A) are not cloned; a new grant must be made on                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
the clone. Future child objects created in the source database (option C) after the clone operation are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
included. Option E is incorrect because it incorrectly limits the cloning to only schemas and tables when all                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
existing objects are included. Cloning in Snowflake is a metadata operation, and since it is a zero-copy clone,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
only metadata references point to the existing data, making the cloning process efficient and cost-effective.

Snowflake's cloning mechanism, while powerful, operates on a metadata copy basis and does not

When a database is cloned, it essentially                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
creates a point-in-time copy of the database's metadata, which includes the definitions of views and stored

So, if a stored procedure or a view

Snowflake does not automatically update these internal references to point to the newly cloned tables. This is

The intention is to produce a quick copy based on a specific

Instead, cloning provides a lightweight, efficient duplication without

This behavior also promotes a level of consistency when performing various testing

The correct answers are C and E. Snowflake clones leverage metadata operations, making their creation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
significantly faster than the data duplication process involved in CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
statements. A clone is effectively a pointer to the original data, not a physical copy, which results in nearinstantaneous creation, whereas CTAS requires the creation of an entirely new table with data copies.                                                                                                                      
Regarding storage, clones don't duplicate data until modifications occur to either the clone or the source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
They initially share the same underlying storage, leading to considerable space savings compared to a CTASoperation which always creates a complete data copy. This shared-storage mechanism, known as copy-onwrite, is a vital element in clone optimization. Option A is incorrect as clones do not stay synchronized with the        
original table; they are point-in-time snapshots. Option B is inaccurate; clones do not inherently offer better                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
query performance than tables created with CTAS, performance is based on data size and query patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option D is correct that clones preserve time travel history from the source table which CTAS would not.

What is the recommended way to obtain a cloned table with the same grants as the source table?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A. Clone the table with the COPY GRANTS command.<br>B. Use an ALTER TABLE command to copy the grants.<br>C. Clone the schema then drop the unwanted tables.<br>D. Create a script to extract grants and apply them to the cloned table.

The correct answer is A. Clone the table with the COPY GRANTS command. Snowflake's CREATE TABLE ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
CLONE statement, when used with the COPY GRANTS option, provides the most direct and efficient method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
for replicating a table along with all its associated access control privileges (grants). This command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
automatically duplicates not only the table's data and schema but also the permissions granted to users,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
roles, and other security principals, ensuring consistency in access control between the source and cloned                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
tables. Option B is incorrect because ALTER TABLE doesn't support copying grants from another table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option C is an unnecessarily complex approach as it would clone all objects in a schema rather than thespecified table. Option D introduces unnecessary overhead, as it requires manual extraction of grants through                                                                                                                    
scripting which is prone to errors and not the optimal approach provided by Snowflake. COPY GRANTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
simplifies the cloning process and reduces the administrative burden of maintaining consistent access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
policies during cloning operations. It aligns with best practices in cloud computing that emphasize automation                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
and the least privilege principle for security.

When a database is cloned in Snowflake, it creates a point-in-time copy of the entire database, including its                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
schema, tables, views, and other database objects. Critically, this clone also replicates the access control                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
configuration. However, the crucial distinction lies in where those replicated privileges apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option A is incorrect because privileges are retained. Privileges are an integral part of the cloned database’s                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option B is incorrect because while cloning replicates privileges, it does so for child objects within the                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
database, not the database itself. Privileges on the database object itself are not automatically inherited by

Think of it this way: the clone is a copy of the internal structure with the same internal                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
permissions structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option D is too specific. While schema objects are child objects, the answer needs to encompass all child                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
objects, including tables, views, stages, etc., not just those within schemas.Option C is correct because Snowflake replicates the granted privileges to the objects within the cloned

Essentially, the permission structure within the database

In summary, database cloning in Snowflake duplicates the structure and the internal privilege configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The permissions granted on child objects are preserved in the clone, enabling consistent access control in the

When you clone a table in Snowflake, the cloned table initially shares the underlying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
storage with the original (until data changes). Snowflake distinguishes between:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Owned storage: Data physically owned by the table (e.g., after insert/update).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Referenced storage: Shared data blocks (e.g., from the source table before changes).
