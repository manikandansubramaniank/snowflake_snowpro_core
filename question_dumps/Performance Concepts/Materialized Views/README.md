The correct answer is D: A Materialized View cannot be defined with a JOIN. Materialized Views in Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
are designed to pre-compute and store the results of a query for faster access. However, they have limitations                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
on the complexity of the queries they can use. Currently, Snowflake does not support creating Materialized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Views that are based on JOIN operations. This is a significant restriction as JOINs are fundamental for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
combining data from multiple tables in a relational database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option A is incorrect because Materialized Views can support aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is a common use case for Materialized Views - to pre-aggregate data for reporting and analytical                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
purposes. Option B is also incorrect; the number of tables a Materialized View can reference isn't strictly                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
limited to two, although the complexity of the query does play a role, but primarily, JOINs are the prohibitive                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
factor, not the count. Option C is incorrect because Materialized Views can be joined with other tables in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
subsequent queries, once they exist. The constraint is at the definition stage, not the usage stage. TheMaterialized View acts like a regular table once created.                                                                                                                                                                         
The limitation of not supporting JOINs is in place because materializing JOIN results can lead to complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
update and maintenance challenges, especially in scenarios involving frequent data changes in the underlying                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
tables. Maintaining the consistency and accuracy of materialized JOIN results would require significant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
overhead. Therefore, Snowflake imposes this restriction to ensure the efficiency and reliability of its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Materialized View implementation. To work around this limitation, one might need to create multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Materialized Views and then join them in a subsequent query, or use regular views and appropriate

The correct answer is CD. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
C. How often the base table changes: Materialized views are pre-computed data sets based on underlying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
tables. When the base table changes, Snowflake needs to refresh the materialized view to keep it consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
This refresh process consumes credits because it involves compute resources to re-execute the defining                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
query and update the materialized view's storage. Frequent base table changes lead to more frequent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
refreshes and thus higher credit consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
D. Whether the materialized view has a cluster key defined: Cluster keys are used to physically organize the                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
data in a table (or materialized view) for efficient query processing. While cluster keys themselves don't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
directly cause credit consumption, they indirectly affect it by influencing the efficiency of materialized view                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
refreshes. If the materialized view is clustered well, the refresh operation might be more efficient as only the                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
relevant partitions needs to be updated. Conversely, a poorly clustered view can lead to increased data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
shuffling and re-writing during refresh, thus consuming more credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option A is incorrect because secure views are a different feature and the security aspect does not directly

Option E is correct because materialized views shine when the results of a query are relatively static and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
heavily used. If the underlying data doesn't change frequently, the materialized view doesn't need constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
refreshing. This allows users to access the pre-computed results repeatedly without incurring the cost of rerunning the query. The more frequently the pre-computed results are used, the greater the benefit of having                                                                                                                   
the materialized view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option A is incorrect since if the query has minimal cost, a materialized view is unnecessary overhead. Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
C is generally incorrect; frequent base table updates imply equally frequent materialized view refreshes,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
which can negate the performance benefits by adding computational overhead. Option D is also incorrect; if                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
the query is already highly optimized and efficient, a materialized view would provide little to no performance                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
improvement and would only add storage cost and potential refresh overhead.

When a user queries a secure view, they only see the data the view is defined to show, even                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
if they have privileges on the underlying table. Snowflake transparently executes the view's query, ensuring                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
data masking and fine-grained access control at the view level. This is a key security feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Materialized View (E): Materialized views precompute and store the results of a view's query. This allows for                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
faster query performance when the view is accessed, as the data doesn't need to be recalculated each time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The data in a materialized view is automatically refreshed by Snowflake based on changes to the underlying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
tables. This trade-off between storage and performance is a standard data warehousing concept.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Layered view (A): While you can create views on top of other views to create a "layered" structure, "Layered                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
view" is not a specific type of view explicitly defined and recognized as a standard view type by Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
This is more of an architectural pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
External view (C): External tables are a supported feature in Snowflake, which point to data stored in external                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
cloud storage like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. However, there are no 'external                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
views'. You can create views on external tables, but this just creates a standard view that pulls data from the                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
external table. The view itself isn't categorized as an "external view."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Embedded view (D): "Embedded view" is not a recognized view type in the Snowflake documentation or its

In summary, Snowflake's view types include Secure views, which focus on data security and access control,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
and Materialized views, which focus on improving query performance. The other options, although potentially

A Snowflake user wants to optimize performance for a query that queries only a small number of rows in a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The rows require significant processing. The data in the table does not change frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
What should the user do?

The correct answer is C. Create a materialized view based on the query. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Materialized views in Snowflake store the pre-computed results of a query. When a user queries the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
materialized view, Snowflake can directly return the stored results instead of re-executing the complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
processing logic on the base table. This is highly beneficial when dealing with complex computations over a                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
small subset of rows, as it eliminates repetitive processing. Because the base table's data doesn't change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
often, the materialized view will remain relatively up-to-date with minimal overhead.

performance over a broader range of queries, not specifically focused on complex row-level processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option B, the search optimization service, aims to improve the performance of point lookups using indexed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
columns but doesn't address computationally heavy transformations. Option D, query acceleration service,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
dynamically adds compute resources to a query if it requires more processing power. While helpful, it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
not prevent the underlying complex computations, and in this case, we're focused on avoiding those entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Creating the materialized view provides a significant performance boost by directly addressing the

The correct answer is A: Materialized views do not allow joins. In Snowflake, materialized views are designed                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
for pre-calculating and storing the results of a single query, thus improving query performance by avoiding                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
repeated computations. They are optimized for summarizing or pre-aggregating data from a single base table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Consequently, joins, which combine data from multiple tables, are not supported within the definition of a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
materialized view. This limitation stems from the fact that maintaining consistency and efficiently updating                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
materialized views becomes increasingly complex with joins, potentially diminishing the performance gains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
intended by using them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option B is incorrect. Materialized views in Snowflake cannot be directly cloned like regular tables or views by                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
user commands. Snowflake handles the underlying structure and data refresh mechanism internally. Cloning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
a materialized view is not a typical operation. Option C is incorrect because, as previously explained,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
materialized views are limited to a single base table; joins are not permitted. Option D is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
while aggregate functions can be used within a materialized view's query to aggregate data from a single

Window functions operate on a set of rows related to the

Therefore, the limitation

materialized snapshot of a single source, which is updated incrementally. This limitation differs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
from standard views, which can combine data from multiple tables using joins and complex logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
B is incorrect because Snowflake automatically manages the refresh of materialized views;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
therefore the data is not stale. C is incorrect because Snowflake handles materialized view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
refresh automatically and no maintenance is required from the user. D is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
querying a materialized view is generally faster because the results have already been calculated,

By restricting to a single table, Snowflake can

The correct answer is A. The base tables do not change frequently. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Materialized views in Snowflake store pre-computed results, unlike regular views which execute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
their defining query every time they're accessed. This caching mechanism makes materialized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
views significantly faster for frequently accessed queries, particularly those involving complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
aggregations or joins. However, this benefit comes at a cost: materialized views require ongoing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
When base tables change, Snowflake must refresh the materialized view to reflect those changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
This refresh process consumes resources and incurs a cost. Therefore, materialized views are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
most beneficial when the base tables don’t change frequently. If data is constantly being updated,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
the frequent refreshes could negate the performance benefits and become expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option B is incorrect because frequently changing view results would necessitate frequent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
refreshes of the materialized view, thus diminishing its performance advantage and potentially                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
incurring unnecessary costs. Option C is incorrect since materialized views are most valuable forresource-intensive queries, where the time saved by using pre-computed results is significant.                                                                                                                                           
Option D is incorrect because materialized views are designed for frequently accessed data and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
are a poor choice for rarely used query results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
In essence, choosing between materialized and regular views hinges on the balance between

Materialized views offer superior performance for

Unlike standard views that execute their underlying query every                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
time they are accessed, materialized views persist the result set to disk.

views are derived from a query specification, making them dependent on a base table or view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Changes to the underlying tables trigger an automatic refresh process (in Snowflake), ensuring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
the materialized view data is relatively up-to-date, balancing freshness with performance gains.

The suspension mechanism ensures data integrity and prevents queries from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
returning unexpected results based on an outdated view definition. After the column is dropped,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
to use the view again you would need to recreate the materialized view.

The correct answer is C, Materialized view. Materialized views in Snowflake, unlike regular tables

Snowflake automatically manages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
this refreshing activity, which directly translates to credit consumption. Regular tables are simply

Regular views are merely stored query definitions and don’t involve data storage or maintenance

Therefore, only materialized views require ongoing processing to remain consistent, thus

The maintenance cost covers both the initial creation and the periodic automatic

Let's analyze the behavior of materialized views when their updates are suspended in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake. When a materialized view's refresh process is suspended, the data within it

If a query is executed

Instead, because the view

The error message

When would creating and using a standard view be preferable to using a materialized view?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
A. The underlying query of the view takes a lot of time to run.<br>B. The underlying query of the view is resource-intensive.<br>C. The underlying query of the view is run on large data sets.<br>D. The view results change often.

The correct answer is D, "The view results change often." Standard views are virtual,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
meaning they don't store data. Instead, they execute the underlying query each time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
they're accessed. This makes them ideal when the data they're based on is frequently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
changing because they always provide the most up-to-date results. Materialized views,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
on the other hand, store pre-computed results. While this can speed up access for static                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
data, it creates overhead when data changes often. Each time the base table changes,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
the materialized view needs to be refreshed, which can be resource-intensive and delay                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
access to the most current information. If the results are highly volatile, the constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
refreshes required for materialized views will often outweigh their performance benefits

Materialized views in Snowflake differ significantly from standard views. A regular view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
is simply a stored query; it doesn't store data. When a regular view is queried, Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
executes the underlying query against the base tables in real-time. This consumes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
credits only during query execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
In contrast, a materialized view physically stores the results of a query. This precomputed data allows for much faster query performance because Snowflake doesn't                                                                                                                                                                       
need to re-execute the underlying query every time. However, maintaining this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
materialized data has a cost.

synchronized with the base tables. This refresh process involves re-executing the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
underlying query and updating the stored results. This refresh is managed by Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
and consumes compute resources, which are billed as Snowflake credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
The refresh frequency can be influenced indirectly through factors like the freshness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
requirements or how frequently the underlying data changes. However, the backgroundmaintenance activity still occurs, and credits are consumed.                                                                                                                                                                                           
Tables store data directly but don't have an automated refresh mechanism that

External tables simply point to data
