The statement is True. Snowflake generates unique Query IDs for every query executed within its system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
These IDs are not just unique within a single Snowflake account or region, but they are globally unique across

The correct answer is D. The query is spilling to remote storage. Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
When a Snowflake query's memory requirements exceed the available resources, the system resorts to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
"spilling" data to remote storage (typically cloud storage like S3 or Azure Blob Storage). This is a clear                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
indication that the query is too large to fit entirely within memory. This process involves writing intermediate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
data sets to storage and reading them back during query execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option A is incorrect; a join node using a significant portion of query time might indicate inefficient join                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
strategies or large data sizes but not necessarily memory overflow. Option B is also incorrect; partitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
scanned being equal to partitions total means the query scanned all relevant data and is not related to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
memory problems. Option C is incorrect; the presence of an AggregateOperator is normal and does not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
suggest the query is too large for memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Spilling introduces significant latency as it involves I/O operations that are much slower than in-memory

The correct answer is B: An explain plan can be used to conduct performance analysis without executing a

Explain plans provide a breakdown of how Snowflake intends to execute a query, outlining the steps involved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
in retrieving and processing data. Critically, this plan is generated without actually running the query. This is

with execution. You can see if a full table scan is happening when an index would be more appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The query profiler, in contrast, requires the query to be executed. It analyzes the query execution after it has

While the profiler is extremely useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
for pinpointing performance issues in already executed queries, it's not suitable for preemptive analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Running an explain plan also has no costs associated with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Option A is incorrect because while Snowflake's web interface provides a graphical representation of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
query profile, it doesn't offer a graphical output for the explain plan itself.

Option C is incorrect. Both explain plans and the query profiler can handle queries involving temporary tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Temporary tables simply exist for the duration of the session or query in which they are created.

Number of partitions scanned (C): Snowflake organizes data into micro-partitions. When a query executes,

partitions scanned is a key optimization goal. This can be achieved by adding appropriate WHERE clauses,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
leveraging clustering, or using materialized views. Scanning fewer partitions directly reduces the amount of

is a general metric reflecting the overall data processed, which is a symptom of inefficiency if partitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
scanned is too high. External bytes scanned (E) would be relevant if your query involved external tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, the focus should be on reducing the number of partitions scanned and increasing the percentage

Instead, it can retrieve the total row count from the metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
cache. This cache maintains summary information about the table, including the number of rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
This approach offers significant performance benefits. Directly accessing the metadata is much faster than

In summary, Snowflake optimizes this type of COUNT(1) query by directly fetching the total row count from

Snowflake's Query Profile provides insights into query execution and performance. When a warehouse is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
undersized for the workload, it lacks sufficient memory to process the data in-memory. Consequently,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
intermediate results and data that would typically reside in memory during query execution are forced to spill

This spilling significantly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
degrades query performance because accessing data on external storage is much slower than accessing data

Reading and writing to external storage introduce I/O bottlenecks and latency.

The correct answer is D. Remote spillage. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Remote spillage in Snowflake's query profile directly indicates that the virtual warehouse lacks sufficient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
resources (specifically, memory) to process the data in memory. When a warehouse runs out of memory, it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
starts "spilling" data to disk, which is significantly slower. This spilling can be local (to the warehouse nodes)

This clearly points to a warehouse that needs to be scaled up to better accommodate

In summary, the combination of "Partitions total" and "Partitions scanned" gives the clearest picture of how                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
well Snowflake is pruning data during a query execution. A large disparity suggests effective pruning, which

The correct answers are D and E. Snowflake's Query Profile is a powerful tool for analyzing query

Option E, "Data spilling to a local or remote disk," is another common issue the profile reveals. When query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
processing exceeds available memory, Snowflake may start spilling data to disk, slowing down execution

The presence of an Aggregate operator atop a UnionAll operator in a Snowflake query profile strongly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
suggests that a simple UNION (without the ALL keyword) was used in the query. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
UNION ALL directly concatenates the result sets of the individual queries combined by the operator. It does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
not perform any deduplication. Snowflake simply stacks the rows from each query on top of each other. This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
efficient because it avoids extra processing.However, UNION (without ALL) implicitly performs deduplication. It removes duplicate rows from the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
combined result set, which requires comparing all rows from all source queries. To achieve this deduplication,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake adds an Aggregate operator. The Aggregate operator groups all identical rows, effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
counting each distinct combination, and then returns the unique rows.

Option A is incorrect because exploding joins typically manifest as Cartesian products or joins with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
significantly more output rows than input rows, not necessarily with an Aggregate operator after a UnionAll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option B is incorrect because inefficient pruning usually impacts scan operators, making them read more data

The question asks about the privilege required to view a load-monitoring chart related to a Snowflake virtual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
warehouse. Load monitoring charts provide insights into warehouse performance, resource consumption, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
query execution metrics. To access this information, Snowflake employs a specific privilege control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The MONITOR privilege grants a user the ability to view the status, metadata, and usage of Snowflake

They can observe metrics such as query latency, warehouse utilization, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
resource consumption. MONITOR is a read-only privilege, aligned perfectly with the need to view information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
MODIFY privilege allows for altering the configuration of a virtual warehouse. It enables actions such as

privilege grants the ability to use a specific resource, like a database or schema. It doesn't necessarily give                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
access to performance monitoring data. Thus, USAGE alone isn't sufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, the MONITOR privilege is specifically designed to provide visibility into the performance and

The correct answer is C: A query that has not specified join criteria for tables. This leads to an exploding join

with every row in the second table when no join condition is specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
An exploding join occurs when a join operation results in a significantly larger number of rows in the output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
than in the input tables. This happens because each row from the left table is matched with every row from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
the right table, and vice versa. Without a join condition, the database system cannot filter down the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
combinations based on logical criteria related to the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option A is incorrect because the number of LEFT OUTER JOIN statements does not directly cause an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
exploding join. While multiple joins can lead to performance issues, the absence of join criteria is the specific

Option B is incorrect. UNION without ALL removes duplicate rows from the combined result set. This might                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
lead to performance overhead, but it does not cause an exploding join. UNION ALL simply appends the result

due to data transfer overhead, does not inherently cause an exploding join. The amount of data transferred is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
proportional to the number of rows generated and the width of the columns. However, it's the uncontrolled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
growth in the row count due to a missing join predicate, that leads to the data explosion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
An exploding join will lead to extreme processing times and resource consumption.

Exploding joins (B) occur when a join operation produces a significantly larger result set than the input tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
This can be identified in the Query Profile by examining the number of rows processed at each stage of the

The correct answer is D, SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID(2). The LAST_QUERY_ID function in Snowflake is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
designed to retrieve the query ID of a previously executed query within the current session. It takes an integer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
argument representing the offset from the most recently executed query. A value of 1 retrieves the ID of the

Therefore, to find the query ID of the second query executed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
current session, we need an offset of 2. Options A, B, and C are incorrect. Option A, LAST_QUERY_ID(-2), is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
not a valid input as the offset must be positive. Option B, LAST_QUERY_ID(-1), is also invalid for the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
reason. Option C, LAST_QUERY_ID(1), would provide the ID of the most recently executed query, not the

Option C correctly captures this purpose by stating it stores "query details such as the objects included and

The correct answer is B. Snowflake cancels any queries submitted during this session that are still running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Here's the justification:Snowflake, like many database systems, operates with the concept of sessions. A session is a logical                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
connection between a user and the Snowflake service. When a user initiates a query, it's tied to their specific

If the user exits Snowsight (or any client tool) without explicitly closing the session, that session

However, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
user’s connection to that session is gone. When Snowsight closes, it does not persist the context of a running                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
query for later retrieval. The query's execution isn't designed to persist indefinitely for a disconnected user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Instead, to manage resources effectively and prevent queries from running indefinitely without user oversight,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake defaults to canceling queries associated with the disconnected session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
This behavior aligns with typical database practices to avoid resource leaks and orphaned processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake doesn't automatically persist a session's state and resume it later upon the next login. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
answer D, suggesting queries will complete upon next login, is incorrect. Canceling the running query is a

This behavior ensures that the Snowflake environment remains

The correct answer is A. INTERSECT. The INTERSECT set operator in SQL, and specifically in Snowflake,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
returns only the rows (or in this case, numeric values) that are found in both input tables or result sets. It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
effectively identifies the common elements between the two datasets. Options B, C, and D are incorrect in this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
scenario. MERGE is typically used for updating or inserting data based on matching conditions, not for findingcommon values. MINUS (also sometimes called EXCEPT) returns rows from the first table that are not present                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
in the second, effectively finding the differences. UNION combines the rows from two tables, including                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
duplicates with UNION ALL, or distinct rows with just UNION, but doesn't isolate only the shared elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, if the goal is to identify numeric values present in both tables, INTERSECT is the appropriate set

In Snowflake, temporary tables exist within a user's session and are not persistent. They have precedence

PARTITION BY divides the rows into partitions based on specified columns. Window functions then

This is crucial for tasks like calculating running                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
totals or ranking within categories, effectively isolating calculations to relevant subsets of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
It's analogous to a GROUP BY clause, but without aggregating rows down, therefore maintaining                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
data dimensionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
ORDER BY within the OVER clause determines the order in which the window function is applied

Snowflake supports several types of subqueries, crucial for complex data analysis and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
manipulation. Uncorrelated scalar subqueries, which return a single value, can be placed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
wherever a value expression is valid within a query, such as in SELECT lists, WHERE clauses, or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
HAVING clauses. This flexibility allows for dynamic calculations and comparisons based on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
results from other queries. Additionally, Snowflake supports EXISTS, ANY/ALL, and IN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
subqueries specifically within WHERE clauses. These subqueries are powerful for filtering based                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
on the presence, or comparison of values returned by an inner query. Critically, these EXISTS,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
ANY/ALL, and IN subqueries can be either correlated or uncorrelated. This means that the inner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
subquery may or may not depend on values from the outer query, allowing for sophisticated data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
filtering. While options C and D limit the usage of EXISTS/ANY/ALL/IN subqueries to only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
uncorrelated or correlated versions, option E correctly specifies that both correlated and

The correct answer is D, stating that User2 will be unable to view the result set of User1's query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is because Snowflake's query history access is strictly controlled based on the user who

Even with administrative roles like SYSADMIN, SECURITYADMIN, or

query's filter conditions (e.g., WHERE clause). This dramatically limits the number of micropartitions that Snowflake actually needs to read and process, significantly accelerating query

micro-partitions. Query pruning is the specific method that leverages metadata to exclude micropartitions that do not contain relevant data, directly impacting the amount of data read from disk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
This is a core feature that allows Snowflake to efficiently handle large datasets.

The correct answer is A, using the RESULT_SCAN function. The SHOW FILE FORMATS command,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
like many other SHOW commands in Snowflake, returns its output as a table-like result set.

metadata is essential for a process called query pruning. When a query with filters is executed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Snowflake's query optimizer leverages these statistics to intelligently skip scanning micropartitions that cannot possibly contain relevant data for the query. This pruning drastically

The key aspect is analyzing how many partitions were skipped, i.e.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the gap between total partitions and scanned partitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Therefore, by comparing the total number of partitions with the number of partitions

recursive definitions. Instead, it provides the CONNECT BY clause to achieve hierarchicalor recursive data querying. CONNECT BY is a proprietary syntax used to traverse parentchild relationships within a single table. This clause starts from a root row and then                                                                                                                                                                                               
iteratively follows the relationship defined in the CONNECT BY condition. This is

LATERAL, and PIVOT, serve different purposes. QUALIFY is used to filter results based

DML (Data Manipulation Language) operators are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
those that modify data within tables. Merge is a DML operation used to insert, update, or

STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS dictates the maximum time a query can execute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
If a query exceeds this limit, it is automatically terminated, preventing it from consuming
