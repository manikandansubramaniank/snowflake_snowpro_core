The correct answer is C, a query that uses equality predicates or predicates that use IN.

Service in Snowflake is designed to significantly accelerate point lookups and selective queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Equality predicates (using the "=" operator) and IN predicates (checking for membership within a list of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
values) are prime candidates for optimization because they allow Snowflake to efficiently identify and retrieve

The service builds and maintains a persistent data structure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
which enables faster data retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option A is less effective. Disjunction (OR) predicates often require Snowflake to scan multiple potentialmatches, diminishing the benefits of search optimization compared to precise lookups. While it might help

In essence, Search Optimization excels when narrowing down the search space quickly, and equality and IN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
predicates are the most direct ways to achieve this.Because Snowflake stores its data in micro-partitions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
using search optimization, specifically with equality predicates, will allow for the system to quickly retrieve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
the micro-partitions needed without scanning a large amount of unneeded data.

These queries need fast and efficient data retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Clustering, while beneficial for overall query performance by organizing data physically, doesn't specifically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
target point lookups in the same direct manner as Search Optimization. Clustering optimizes for range scans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and queries that filter on a clustered key, not necessarily single-value lookups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Materialized views pre-compute and store query results, which can speed up some queries. However, they                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
require maintenance and are not universally applicable to all types of point lookups, especially if the filtering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
criteria change frequently. They are also more suited for aggregation and complex joins rather than simple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
key-based lookups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Zero-copy cloning creates a copy of a database, schema, or table without duplicating the underlying data

While useful for development and testing, it does not inherently improve the performance of point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
lookup queries. It only creates a new environment with the same (potentially slow) query performance

specified criteria in point lookup queries. It dramatically reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned

Snowflake automatically determines when and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
how to use the search optimization data structure, simplifying its application. The service uses statistics and

Point lookups, also known as selective queries, involve retrieving specific rows based on equality or IN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
conditions on one or more columns. SOS creates a persistent data structure that functions similarly to anindex, enabling Snowflake to quickly locate and retrieve the matching rows without scanning the entire table.                                                                                                                                                                                          
Traditional indexes can struggle with the dynamic nature of data in cloud data warehouses and the need for

Snowflake's SOS overcomes these limitations by automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and transparently maintaining its optimization structures as data is added, modified, or deleted. This ensures

operations by keeping its structures up-to-date, its primary goal isn't to optimize queries impacted by DML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Tables larger than 1 TB can benefit from SOS, but the service is more specifically tuned for queries requiring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the retrieval of small subsets of data. Moreover, SOS doesn't directly optimize queries on a subset of columns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
if those columns aren't used in a selective filter. The core function of SOS lies in efficiently locating targeted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
rows defined by conditions like WHERE column = value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, selective point lookup queries are the specific type of queries that benefit directly from the

Optimization Service is specifically designed to accelerate queries that use equality predicates (e.g., WHERE

It achieves this by creating a persistent, optimized data structure that efficiently maps

Option B: Cluster a table. Clustering in Snowflake physically reorganizes data within micro-partitions based                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
on specified clustering keys. This grouping of similar data significantly reduces the amount of data Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
needs to scan for queries filtering on or joining with those keys. By strategically clustering data based on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
commonly used filters, data access becomes much more efficient, accelerating query execution. This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
because Snowflake can skip irrelevant micro-partitions that do not contain the data required by the query,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
directly improving query performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option C: Enable the search optimization service. The search optimization service automatically enhances                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
query performance for selective queries on large tables. It achieves this by creating a separate search access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
path structure (e.g. inverted index) optimized for fast lookups. Instead of relying solely on table scans,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake can quickly locate the relevant data through this structure. This reduces data scanned leading to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
better performance, particularly for queries using filters on columns added to the optimization service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
However, it comes with a cost associated with storage, so it needs to be thoughtfully implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
A. Create a view: Creating a view does not improve underlying query performance on the base tables. It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
essentially creates a saved query that references tables. The query against the view still executes against the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
underlying table and would benefit from B or C, but a view alone is not a performance optimizer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
D. Enable Time Travel: Time Travel allows users to access historical data in Snowflake, but it doesn't improve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
query performance in general. It has no impact on performance optimization of recent data queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
E. Index a table: While indexing is a common strategy in traditional databases, Snowflake does not support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
manual indexing of tables. Snowflake handles indexing internally with features like clustering and the search                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
optimization service. User defined indexes are not an option.

In summary, clustering tables and enabling the search optimization service are two effective methods to

The Search Optimization Service in Snowflake is specifically designed to dramatically improve the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
performance of queries that involve selective filters, often expressed as extensive WHERE clause conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
These filters typically target specific values or ranges within columns. Without search optimization,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Snowflake might need to scan a large amount of data to satisfy the filtering conditions, leading to slow query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
execution times. The Search Optimization Service addresses this by creating a specialized search index for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
the table. This index allows Snowflake to rapidly locate the relevant data blocks required by a query, skipping

This process drastically reduces the I/O overhead and overall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
query latency. The service automatically maintains the search index whenever data in the table is updated,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
ensuring query performance remains optimized over time. It is important to understand that the searchoptimization service is not a generic query accelerator but tailored for queries that perform targeted lookups

The correct answer is D. Casts on table columns (except for fixed-point numbers cast to strings).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake's search optimization service primarily accelerates queries by optimizing data access based on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
predicates within the WHERE clause. It functions by creating a search access path, which is essentially a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
mapping of values to data locations within a table. This optimization focuses on how data is physically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
accessed. Casting operations, such as converting data types, can impact the effectiveness of this mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake's documentation clearly states that search optimization can be used on columns that have casts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
with specific exceptions. This is because when you cast a data type, the internal representation of a value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
might change. For example, casting strings to numbers. This new representation may hinder the existing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
search access path if not explicitly accounted for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
However, it’s important to note that casts on fixed-point numbers to strings specifically aren't supported. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
is primarily due to the complexities of string representations of floating point numbers and how that interacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
with the service's internal data structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Options A, B, and C are incorrect because search optimization doesn't directly work on external tables or

The correct answer is D ("Use a smaller number of larger tables rather than a larger number ofsmaller tables"). This approach benefits from Snowflake’s columnar storage and micropartitioning architecture. Snowflake stores data in immutable micro-partitions, which are                                                                                                                                     
automatically organized and optimized. Larger tables with fewer partitions allow the system to

can be substantial. Using fewer, larger tables minimizes this overhead, allowing for more effective

Moreover, joining across a larger number of tables introduces additional processing time and

The correct answer is B: "Queries with large scans and selective filters." Here's why:

of queries by allocating additional compute resources. It's most effective when queries involve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
scanning a significant portion of a table (large scans) but then filter out most of the data based on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
selective criteria. This scenario creates a bottleneck where the initial scan takes a long time, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
the filtering operation, though simple, is applied to a very large intermediary dataset.

completion of these types of queries.Option A is incorrect because queries without filters or aggregations are typically simple and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
often processed quickly with standard compute resources; acceleration wouldn't provide much                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
benefit. Option C is not ideal, as queries with high cardinality in the GROUP BY clause might                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
benefit from general query optimization strategies like clustering more so than acceleration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option D, while search optimization can improve performance, it's a separate feature focused on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
optimizing search terms, not general large table scans with filters. The query acceleration is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
focused on the computation resources, while the search optimization is on data organization and

A. It scans the micro-partitions based on the joins used in the queries and scans only join columns.<br>B. It maintains a persistent data structure that keeps track of the values of the table’s columns in each of its<br>C. It scans the local disk cache to avoid scans on the tables used in the query.<br>D. It keeps track of running queries and their results and saves those extra scans on the table.

When a query is executed, Snowflake consults this access path to identify which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
micro-partitions are likely to contain the data required, based on the predicates in the WHERE

This approach is distinct from simply caching data or focusing solely on join columns. Option A is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
incorrect because while join operations are crucial, the search optimization service operates on

Option C is inaccurate because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
while local disk caching plays a role in performance, it's not the primary function of this specific

Option D describes query caching, which is a separate optimization technique from the

The key here is that the Search Optimization Service builds an index-like structure, not on the

It achieves this by creating a persistent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
data structure that stores information about how values are distributed within the table. When aquery with equality predicates is submitted, the query engine can use this metadata to skip

Search access paths maintain mappings of values to the micro-partitions that

performance of point lookup queries against large tables. Point lookups are queries that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
use highly selective filters (e.g., equality or IN clauses) to retrieve a small subset of

These queries often involve scanning significant portions of the table, leading to
