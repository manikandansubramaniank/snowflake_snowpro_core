The correct scaling policies for Snowflake Virtual Warehouses are Standard and Economy. Let's explore why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake's Virtual Warehouses, which are essentially compute clusters, can automatically adjust their size                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
(scaling) based on workload demands. This scalability ensures optimal performance and cost efficiency. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
scaling policy dictates how the warehouse increases or decreases its compute resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The Standard scaling policy is the default setting. It aims to balance performance and cost. Snowflake will                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
automatically scale up the warehouse when necessary to handle increased query load and then scale down                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
when demand decreases. This approach is ideal for most workloads that need both responsiveness and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
reasonable cost management.The Economy scaling policy, on the other hand, prioritizes cost savings over performance. Snowflake will                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
scale up more slowly, and scale down more aggressively than with the standard policy. This makes it suitable

The correct answer is D. To accommodate a more complex workload. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Virtual warehouse sizing in Snowflake directly impacts the compute resources available for query processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
An X-Small warehouse provides a limited amount of compute power, suitable for basic queries or smaller

The correct answers are B and C. Auto-suspend is a feature that automatically shuts down a virtual

While generally beneficial for cost management, there are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
situations where disabling it is advantageous. Option B, "When managing a steady workload," is correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
because a consistent, predictable workload benefits from a continuously running warehouse, avoiding the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
overhead of repeated start-ups. Frequent auto-suspend and resume cycles introduce latency and can disrupt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
performance when processing ongoing, consistent tasks. Option C, "When the compute must be available with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
no delay or lag time," is also correct because auto-suspend incurs a delay when a warehouse needs to restart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
For time-sensitive operations or critical applications, the lag from reactivation can be detrimental. Thus, when

Option A, “When users will be using compute at different times throughout a 24/7 period” is incorrect because

timeframe, Snowflake initiates the suspension process. This means no more compute resources are utilized,

presence of users logged into Snowflake is irrelevant, as a user may be logged in without issuing queries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
requiring compute. The core concept underpinning auto-suspend is inactivity-based scaling, a common costoptimization technique in cloud computing. This ensures resources are allocated and consumed only when

The statement is false. Snowflake does not bill for a minimum of five minutes each time a Virtual Warehouse

Instead, Snowflake bills for the actual compute time used by a Virtual Warehouse, with a minimum

The correct answer is False. Snowflake Virtual Warehouses only consume credits when they are actively

the statement that a virtual warehouse consumes credits even when inactive is incorrect. Snowflake's pay-asyou-go model ensures you're only charged for the compute power you actually use. This elasticity and ondemand nature is a cornerstone of cloud computing resource management, providing flexibility and cost

A. Root task may be executed concurrently (i.e. multiple instances), it is recommended to leave some margins in<br>B. Querying (SELECT) the size of the stream content would help determine the warehouse size. For example, if<br>C. If using the stored procedure to execute multiple SQL statements, it's best to test run the stored procedure<br>D. Since task infrastructure is based on running the task body on schedule, it's recommended to configure the

The correct answer is C. The size of the virtual warehouse and D. The length of time the warehouse is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
running. Snowflake virtual warehouses are charged based on compute resources consumed, measured in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
credits. The size of the warehouse directly correlates to the compute power allocated (e.g., X-Small, Small,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Medium, Large, etc.). Larger warehouses, having more compute resources, consume more credits per unit of

It's important to auto-suspend a warehouse when it’s idle to prevent unnecessary credit expenditure.

The correct answer is B. Experiment by running the same queries against warehouses of different sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Snowflake doesn't prescribe a single warehouse size for all workloads due to varying query complexities and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
data volumes. Instead, it advocates an iterative approach. Option B aligns with this principle by suggesting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
experimentation with different warehouse sizes to find the optimal fit.

Option A's suggestion to start with X-Small and increase if queries don't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
complete in 2 minutes is arbitrary and doesn't account for different needs. Option C is unsuitable as the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
default warehouse size is not guaranteed to be the most efficient. Option D is too rigid. Larger warehouses do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
offer more compute power and may be needed for larger workloads, but blindly starting with X-Large is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
unnecessary and potentially cost-prohibitive. The best practice is to empirically identify the right size through

Option B is incorrect because economy scaling doesn't focus on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
increasing performance but cost optimization. Option C is incorrect for the same reason as option A;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
minimizing queuing isn't the priority for economy scaling.

Okay, let's break down why option A is the correct answer and why the others are less likely in this scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The core issue is slow response times with 300 concurrent users on a single-cluster warehouse, despite small

doesn't address the core issue of resource saturation.

connectivity and data transfer; they would not be the primary reason for slow response times. Moreover, if                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
drivers are an issue, there would most likely be outright connection errors, not just slowdowns.

D, concerning data caching, would not cause consistent slow performance when dealing with small queries, if

The correct answer is B. The warehouse is too small. Increase the size of the warehouse to reduce the

size provides more memory and compute resources. This enables the query to hold more intermediate data in

The correct answer is D. WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION. When modifying a virtual warehouse in Snowflake,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
especially when scaling up its compute resources, the ALTER WAREHOUSE command might return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
immediately, even if the provisioning of the additional resources isn't complete. Without explicit confirmation,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
subsequent queries might not benefit from the scaled-up resources until the process is entirely finished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION parameter, used within the ALTER WAREHOUSE command, ensures the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
command doesn't complete until the requested scaling operation is fully executed. This verifies that the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
additional compute resources are fully provisioned and the warehouse is ready to handle the increased

The correct answer is B and C. Auto-suspend for virtual warehouses in Snowflake is designed to automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
shut down a warehouse after a period of inactivity to save on compute costs. However, there are scenarios

Option B, "When managing a steady workload," is accurate because with a consistent and predictable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
workload, the overhead of repeated warehouse startup times from auto-suspend can outweigh the cost                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
savings. Disabling auto-suspend ensures the warehouse is always ready, avoiding latency from startup and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
optimizing performance for consistent data processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option C, "When the compute must be available with no delay or lag time," is also correct because autosuspension introduces a cold-start latency when the warehouse needs to be reactivated. This latency, while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
typically short, can be unacceptable for time-critical applications. Disabling auto-suspend guarantees                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
immediate availability, crucial for applications requiring instantaneous query processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option A is incorrect because auto-suspend is intended to handle varying workload demands, effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
managing compute costs for intermittent usage. Option D is incorrect as auto-suspend is an automatic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
function to turn off the warehouse, not to manually turn it on. Option E is not the main reason to consider                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
disabling auto-suspend. While sharing a warehouse can influence workload patterns, the primary reasonsrelate to consistent workloads and the need for immediate compute availability.

Following this pattern, a Large warehouse consumes twice the credits of a Medium warehouse,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
resulting in 8 credits/hour (4 2). Hence, option B, representing 8 credits per hour, is the correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
answer. The sizing of a virtual warehouse directly impacts its performance and cost, and

The correct answer is C. Enable standard warehouse scaling. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Snowflake's virtual warehouses provide compute resources for query execution. When a single,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
large, complex query is slow, it usually indicates insufficient compute power.

warehouse allows more resources to be allocated for the query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Standard warehouse scaling (multi-cluster scaling) automatically adjusts the warehouse size                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
based on the workload. When a single large query is submitted, this scaling mechanism allows the

Here's a detailed breakdown of how to calculate the Snowflake warehouse credits in this scenario:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake bills based on warehouse size and the time the warehouse is actively running. A 3XLarge warehouse consumes 128 credits per hour when running. Since the warehouse initially runs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
with one cluster, the credit consumption for the first hour is 128 credits (1 cluster 128

Therefore, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
consumption rate doubles to 256 credits per hour (2 clusters 128 credits/hour). To determine the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
total credits used, sum the credits consumed for each hour. In the first hour, there are 128 credits,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and in the second hour, there are 256 credits. Adding 128 and 256 results in 384 credits.

Increasing concurrent users on a Snowflake virtual warehouse means more queries are competing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
for the same computational resources. While Snowflake's architecture does a great job of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
handling concurrency, it isn't infinitely scalable. As the number of concurrent users increases,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
each user's queries will eventually start to experience resource contention. This resource                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
contention directly impacts the performance of large, complex queries, as these queries require                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
significant processing power and memory. With more queries vying for these limited resources,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
there will be queuing, delays, and ultimately, a reduction in performance. Simple queries, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
require minimal resources, may not be significantly affected in the initial stages of concurrency

However, the consumption of Snowflake credits is not necessarily decreased; often, it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
will increase due to the additional processing being performed. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Key factors at play:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Resource Contention: The core issue is that a virtual warehouse has finite CPU, memory, and I/O

complex queries are particularly sensitive to this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Query Queuing: As resource limits are reached, new queries might get queued and will have to

The correct answer is C. When you resize a suspended Snowflake virtual warehouse, the change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
doesn't take effect immediately. Instead, the configuration change is stored, and the new size is

involves addressing resource bottlenecks. Reducing queuing (A) is crucial. When queries wait in a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
queue before execution, response times suffer. This often indicates insufficient compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
resources for the workload. Increasing the warehouse size (D), which means selecting a larger Tshirt size (e.g., from X-Small to Small, or Small to Medium), directly provides more compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
power (CPU and RAM). This allows the warehouse to execute more queries concurrently and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
process data faster, ultimately reducing or eliminating queuing.

spillage (B) occurs when the warehouse exceeds its memory capacity, forcing it to use slower disk

results are then written to local storage or, if that's exhausted, to remote storage. This process,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
known as "spilling," significantly degrades query performance due to slower I/O operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
compared to in-memory processing. A larger virtual warehouse has more compute resources,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
including RAM, allowing it to hold more data in memory. This reduces the likelihood of spilling and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
keeps the query processing within the fast memory layer, improving overall query speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Increasing the warehouse's maximum timeout (B) will not affect data spill, as it only determines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
how long the query can run. Increasing remote storage (C) won't prevent spills; it simply provides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
a slower location to store spilled data once memory is exhausted. Finally, using CTEs (D), while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
improving query readability and modularity, has no direct impact on resource allocation or spilling

Larger virtual warehouse sizes directly increase the available memory for query execution,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
thereby reducing spilling. This aligns with the principle of resource allocation to match workload

When resources are adequate, the query runs efficiently.

The recommended practice for auto-suspension of Snowflake query warehouses revolves around                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
balancing cost-efficiency with user experience. Setting the auto-suspension too aggressively can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
disrupt ongoing queries, requiring restarts and potentially leading to frustration. Conversely,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
keeping warehouses running longer than needed results in unnecessary compute charges.

Snowflake virtual warehouses consume credits while they are actively running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
When a warehouse is idle, meaning it's not processing any queries, it still incurs costs if

Automating suspension allows the warehouse to automatically shut

standard cloud computing practice for cost savings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Resource monitors allow administrators to control the credit consumption of awarehouse (or a group of warehouses). By attaching a resource monitor to a warehouse,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
administrators can set limits and receive alerts when usage approaches these limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This is also a core aspect of cloud cost governance and resource management.

warehouse automatically starts up when a query is submitted and queued because no                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
warehouse is available. Without this, a user might manually start the warehouse,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
potentially before it's needed, wasting credits. Critically, queues indicate demand, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
auto-resume efficiently addresses this demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
E. Auto-suspend after a specified period of inactivity: Auto-suspend is a crucial feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
for cost control. When a warehouse becomes idle (no queries are running), it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
automatically suspends after a pre-defined period. This prevents unnecessary credit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
consumption when the warehouse is not actively being used. Without auto-suspend, a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
warehouse might remain running for extended periods without processing any queries,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
leading to significant cost overruns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not effective ways to manage

B. Auto-resume after a set time period: This is arbitrary and doesn't correlate with actual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
workload. It can lead to the warehouse running even when there are no queries to

C. Auto-suspend while the query is being written: This is impractical and nonsensical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The warehouse is needed to execute the query, not just when it's written.

Snowflake's recommendation is to find a balance between availability and cost, and a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
low auto-suspend value, in conjunction with auto-resume, helps achieve this by ensuring
