Micro-partitions in Snowflake are fundamental units of storage, crucial for its performance and scalability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option A is correct; these partitions are indeed approximately 16MB in size when uncompressed. This fixed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
size helps Snowflake manage data effectively, enabling parallel processing and efficient data retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option C is also correct. Micro-partitions are immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be altered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
When data is updated, new micro-partitions are created, reflecting the changed state. This immutability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
simplifies data management and enables features like Time Travel and Fail-safe. Option B is incorrect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
because Snowflake automatically compresses all data within micro-partitions, regardless of any user-defined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
settings; it does not depend on a COMPRESS=TRUE option. Option D is also incorrect, as Snowflake encrypts

Snowflake, like many columnar databases, internally compresses data for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
efficient storage and retrieval. While the uncompressed data within a single row can be much larger,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Snowflake imposes a limit on the size of a compressed row. This limit is 16MB. Exceeding this limit will result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
in an error when writing data to the table. This restriction is in place to optimize performance and maintain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
stability of the system. Large row sizes, even compressed, can lead to slower data processing due to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
increased I/O operations and memory consumption. By enforcing a maximum size, Snowflake ensures that its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
query engine operates efficiently and predictably. The 16MB limit also relates to how Snowflake manages and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
distributes data internally. Smaller compressed chunks of data are easier to move around and process in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
parallel, contributing to faster query execution. While this 16MB limit can seem small, it rarely becomes an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
issue in practice due to the strong compression capabilities of Snowflake which typically reduce the size                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
significantly. Users should however be mindful of very large, wide rows and consider normalizing them.

means that it can intelligently skip entire micro-partitions that do not contain data relevant to the query’s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
filter conditions. For example, if a query requests data where column_A > 100, and a micro-partition'smetadata shows that the maximum value for column_A within it is 50, then the entire partition is skipped

The statement is True. Snowflake's Global Services Layer is indeed responsible for managing metadata aboutdata stored in the system. A crucial part of this metadata is column-level statistics. These statistics include                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
information like min/max values, distinct counts, and null counts for each column within every micro-partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
This detailed statistical information is vital for Snowflake's query optimizer to generate efficient execution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
plans. By understanding the distribution of data within each column, the optimizer can strategically choose

The correct answer is C: Micro-partitioning is transparently completed using the ordering that occurs when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
the data is inserted/loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Here's why: Snowflake automatically divides data into micro-partitions, which are contiguous units of storage,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
generally between 50-500 MB uncompressed, and organized in a columnar format. The key aspect here is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
that this partitioning process is entirely managed by Snowflake, without requiring any user intervention or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
predefined schemas. This is what makes it "transparent." The data's natural order upon loading or insertion is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
what drives the initial organization within these micro-partitions.

A. Micro-partitioning has been known to introduce data skew: While data skew can be an issue within a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
database, it's not inherently caused by micro-partitioning itself. Data skew results from uneven data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
distribution, regardless of the partitioning method. Micro-partitioning aims to manage the storage andretrieval of data, not create an uneven data spread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
B. Micro-partitioning requires a partitioning schema to be defined up front: This statement is the opposite of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
how micro-partitioning works. It is completely automatic and does not require any upfront schema or

The statement is true. Snowflake's micro-partitions, once written, are immutable.

principle underpins Snowflake's performance, concurrency, and data protection. When data is inserted,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
updated, or deleted, Snowflake doesn't modify existing micro-partitions. Instead, new micro-partitions are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
created to reflect the changes. This approach, known as "copy-on-write" or "immutable data storage," allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
for efficient time travel and fail-safe capabilities, as previous versions of micro-partitions remain intact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake's query processing leverages this immutability to optimize performance by avoiding locking and inplace modifications. The system manages metadata, keeping track of the latest micro-partition versions and

Therefore, even though updates appear to modify data, under

data management advantages. Option B is correct because micro-partitions are indeed immutable objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Once created, their data cannot be directly modified, instead, updates result in new micro-partitions being

By only accessing the required partitions, Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
minimizes data transfer and thereby optimizes performance and costs. Option A is incorrect because micropartitions can, and often do, overlap in their value ranges to ensure data flexibility, avoiding rigid partitioning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
schemes that could be costly to maintain. Option D is false because while data within a micro-partition is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
stored in a columnar format and Snowflake attempts to organize it efficiently, it's not explicitly stored in userdefined sorted order. Lastly, Option E is incorrect because micro-partitioning is automatically managed by

Micro-partition pruning is a crucial performance optimization technique in Snowflake. Snowflake stores data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
in immutable, compressed, and columnar storage units called micro-partitions. Each micro-partition stores                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
metadata about the data it contains, including min/max values, allowing Snowflake to intelligently skip micropartitions that don't contain relevant data for a given query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
When a query is executed, Snowflake's query optimizer analyzes the query's WHERE clause and compares                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
the filter conditions against the metadata of each micro-partition. If the metadata indicates that a micropartition cannot possibly contain any data that satisfies the query's conditions, that micro-partition is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
"pruned" or skipped. This drastically reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned, leading to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
significant performance improvements and cost savings. Without pruning, Snowflake would have to scan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
every single micro-partition in the table, regardless of whether it contains relevant data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option B is incorrect because micro-partition pruning is about avoiding unnecessary overlap, not embracing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option C describes aspects of Snowflake's architecture, but it doesn't accurately define pruning.

Services layer indeed handles caching, but pruning is handled at the data storage layer.

In essence, micro-partition pruning leverages metadata to avoid unnecessary data scanning, a key principle

Here's a detailed justification for why options B and C are correct, and why the other options are incorrect,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
relating to the Snowflake storage layer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The Snowflake storage layer is designed to store the actual data used by the Snowflake system. It is the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
foundation upon which all Snowflake operations are built. Options B and C accurately describe data held                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
within this layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
B. Micro-partitions: This is a fundamental concept in Snowflake's architecture. Data in Snowflake is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
automatically divided into small, contiguous units called micro-partitions. These micro-partitions are stored in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
a columnar format and are the physical containers of the data itself. Snowflake's query optimization and data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
skipping rely heavily on the metadata associated with these micro-partitions, making them a core component                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
of the storage layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
C. Query history: While not the primary data being analyzed, Snowflake stores query history as metadatarelating to past queries. This is used for auditing, debugging, and performance analysis purposes. The query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
history itself needs to be persisted in the storage layer so it can be accessed and queried when necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
A. Snowflake parameters: Snowflake parameters are configuration settings that control the behavior of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake system. While these parameters influence data processing, they are stored in metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
repositories, not directly within the main storage layer alongside the user data.

This can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
be used to store the results of complex and frequently run queries for faster access. The materialized view is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
saved into the Snowflake storage layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
E. Standard and secure view results: Views are virtual tables; they don't physically store data. The results of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
queries against views are dynamically computed based on the underlying tables when the view is accessed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Therefore, the results themselves are not stored in the storage layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In summary: The Snowflake storage layer primarily houses the micro-partitions containing the actual data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
and query history metadata. Other aspects like parameters and view results are handled differently within

The correct answer is C. Micro-partitioning happens when the data is loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Micro-partitioning in Snowflake is a core feature that automatically divides data within a table into small,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
contiguous storage units called micro-partitions. This process occurs transparently to the user, specifically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
during data loading operations. As data is inserted into a Snowflake table, it's automatically organized and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
distributed into these micro-partitions. There's no need for users to define any partitioning schema; Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
manages the partitioning process internally.

The correct answer is B. Partitions scanned is less than partitions total. Efficient pruning, in the context of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, refers to the process of minimizing the amount of data that needs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
be read and processed during query execution. This is achieved by intelligently filtering out unnecessary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
partitions or micro-partitions based on the query's filter conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
When a query is executed, Snowflake analyzes the query and the available data to determine which data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
partitions are relevant. If the query includes filters (such as WHERE clauses), Snowflake attempts to eliminate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
partitions that do not contain any data that satisfies those filters. This process is known as partition pruning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
If all partitions are scanned (option C), it implies no pruning occurred, making the query inefficient. If the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
number of scanned partitions is more than or equal to total partitions (options A and D), it means that either

The correct answer is A. Automatically. Snowflake’s micro-partitions are a fundamental aspect of its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
architecture, enabling efficient storage and query performance. They are not manually defined or created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
using SQL clauses like ORDER BY, PARTITION BY, or GROUP BY. Instead, Snowflake automatically creates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and manages micro-partitions based on the data ingested into tables. This process is transparent to the user,

Columnar storage (A) is a database architecture that stores data in columns rather than rows.

approach is highly efficient for analytical workloads, as it allows Snowflake to read only the specific columns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
required for a query, dramatically reducing I/O operations and improving query performance. Traditional rowbased databases, conversely, load entire rows, even if only a few columns are needed. Micro-partitions (B) are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
small, contiguous units of storage, typically ranging from 50 MB to 500 MB uncompressed. These micropartitions contain data from a single table, allowing for fine-grained data management. Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
automatically divides tables into these micro-partitions and stores data within them. This partitioning is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
transparent to users and provides a scalable and performant way to organize and access data. Unliketraditional database partitions, Snowflake's micro-partitions don't require user configuration. They also

partition is skipped. Options C, D, and E are incorrect; Snowflake doesn't use text file format (C) for storage,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
compresses its data (not uncompressed D), and manages partitions automatically, not user-defined (E).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, the answer correctly reflects the storage mechanics of Snowflake: columnar file format and micropartitions.

How is table data compressed in Snowflake?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
A. Each column is compressed as it is stored in a micro-partition.<br>B. Each micro-partition is compressed as it is written into cloud storage using GZIP.<br>C. The micro-partitions are stored in compressed cloud storage and the cloud storage handles compression.<br>D. The text data in a micro-partition is compressed with GZIP but other types are not compressed.

The correct answer is A: "Each column is compressed as it is stored in a micro-partition." Snowflake utilizes a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
columnar storage architecture within its micro-partitions. This means that data for each column is stored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
separately, rather than row-by-row. Consequently, Snowflake can apply compression techniques optimized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
for the specific data type within each column. Since data within a column often exhibits similar characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
(e.g., strings, integers, dates), compression algorithms can achieve high efficiency. Therefore, each column

The correct answer is A. Pruning is not being performed efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Here's the justification: When a query scans all partitions, it indicates that Snowflake's pruning mechanism is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
failing to eliminate unnecessary data from the scan. Pruning relies on metadata stored about each micropartition, specifically the minimum and maximum values for each column. This metadata helps Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
determine which partitions can be safely skipped when executing a query with a WHERE clause or JOIN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
condition. If all partitions are being scanned, it means that the query is not able to effectively leverage the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
available metadata, which is an indicator of poor pruning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Inefficient pruning can happen for several reasons. First, if the query's WHERE clause or JOIN conditions don't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
involve columns that are well-clustered or sorted in the micro-partitions, Snowflake will struggle to use the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
min/max metadata for pruning. Second, if the query filters use functions or expressions on the columns, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
metadata cannot be used for pruning, resulting in full partition scans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option B, while a contributing factor, does not directly explain the problem of scanning all partitions, though it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
can be a factor in overall query duration. Option C, incorrect joins, would likely lead to incorrect results rather                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
than an indication of full partition scans. Option D, the columns in micro-partitions needing granular ordering,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
relates to clustering which helps with pruning, but the core problem presented is about the ineffectiveness of

In summary: The full partition scan indicates a core issue with pruning, and inefficient or failed pruning is the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
root cause of the query performance problem. Optimizing query filters, ensuring filtering columns are well

Snowflake, a cloud data platform, employs a unique approach to data storage and organization that is critical                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
for its performance and efficiency. When data is loaded into Snowflake, it undergoes a transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
process that significantly differs from traditional database systems. Firstly, Snowflake stores data in a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
columnar format. Unlike row-based storage where data for a single row is stored together, columnar storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
arranges data by column, meaning all values for a specific column are stored contiguously. This method is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
highly beneficial for analytical workloads as queries often involve accessing only a subset of columns. By                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
reading only the required column data, Snowflake avoids reading unnecessary data, leading to faster query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
execution and reduced I/O operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Secondly, Snowflake automatically compresses the stored data. This compression is essential for reducing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
storage costs and improving data transfer speeds. Data compression techniques shrink the size of the data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
which in turn minimizes the amount of storage required and the amount of data that needs to be moved across                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
networks. Snowflake's compression is transparent to the user; that is, users do not need to specify the

The system automatically applies suitable algorithms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
for optimal compression based on the data's characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
The other options are not correct. Binary format (A) is a fundamental storage format and not a reorganization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
strategy. Raw format (D) refers to unprocessed data.

<strong>D, E</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The correct answer is D and E. Snowflake's micro-partitions are designed for efficient querying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
and storage. To achieve this, Snowflake maintains rich metadata about each micro-partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option D is correct because Snowflake tracks the range of values for each column within the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
micro-partition. This is crucial for pruning and efficient data skipping. When a query specifies a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
filter condition on a column, Snowflake can quickly determine which micro-partitions are relevant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
by comparing the filter range with the stored metadata, thus avoiding reading unnecessary data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option E is also correct, as Snowflake maintains the number of distinct values for each column                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
within the micro-partition. This metadata is used to optimize query planning and execution by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
understanding the data distribution and applying appropriate strategies. Option A is incorrect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
because Snowflake doesn't maintain a count of total values in the micro-partition, but rather                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
distinct values. Option B and C are incorrect; while Snowflake tracks ranges, it does so at the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
column level rather than for each partition (within the micro-partition) or individual rows, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
would be too granular and inefficient. The metadata stored is primarily designed for column-level                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
filtering and optimization. The metadata allows Snowflake to optimize query performance by

stores information about the data contained within each micro-partition, enabling intelligent data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
skipping and pruning during query execution. Option A, "Range of values," is correct. Snowflaketracks the minimum and maximum values for each column within a micro-partition. This range                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
metadata allows Snowflake to quickly determine if a micro-partition contains data relevant to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
query's WHERE clause, effectively skipping irrelevant partitions and reducing I/O. Option B,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
"Distinct values," is also correct. Snowflake stores a list of distinct values for each column within

This distinct value metadata helps with query optimization, such as identifying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
when a specific value is not present and therefore can be skipped. Option C, "Index values," is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
incorrect; Snowflake does not maintain explicit index values like traditional databases. Instead, it

Option D, "Sorted values," is incorrect; although data within a micro-partition might be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
inherently sorted based on the load order or clustering key, the metadata doesn't store sorted

Option E, "Null values," is incorrect because while presence of null values is

The correct answer is D. Pruning. Snowflake utilizes a technique called partition pruning (or micropartition pruning) to optimize query performance by minimizing the amount of data scanned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake automatically organizes data into immutable micro-partitions, each containing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
columnar data. When a query is executed, Snowflake's query optimizer analyzes the query's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
predicates (WHERE clause conditions). Using metadata about the values within each micropartition, the optimizer determines which partitions do not contain any data that could satisfy the

These partitions are then “pruned,” meaning they are not scanned at all during query

This selective scanning drastically reduces I/O operations and improves query speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
This contrasts with other approaches; B-trees are indexing structures used for efficient lookups

Snowflake significantly enhances the performance of queries filtering large amounts of data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
primarily through a technique called pruning. Pruning is a query optimization strategy where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake intelligently avoids scanning unnecessary data files by leveraging metadata about the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
data distribution within those files. Instead of reading every file, Snowflake only reads the specific                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
data files that contain data relevant to the query's filter conditions. This is highly efficient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
because it dramatically reduces the amount of I/O operations needed to process the query.

Indexing (A): While Snowflake utilizes a form of micro-partitioning, it does not rely on traditional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
database indexes. The data within each micro-partition is already organized in a columnar fashion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
which allows very fast retrieval. It is also the mechanism that enables effective pruning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
TableScan (C): A table scan means examining all data in a table, which is the opposite of what                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Snowflake aims to achieve for filtered queries. Therefore, it would be less efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Increasing the number of partitions scanned (D): This would increase the data to be scanned and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
thus reduce efficiency, also this statement goes opposite to Snowflake’s objective which is to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
reduce the scanned data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Pruning is a key concept in columnar databases like Snowflake. These databases store data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
column-wise, which enables them to easily access specific columns needed for a query. When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
combined with pruning, column-wise storage becomes extremely efficient.Essentially, Snowflake’s efficient processing hinges on its ability to use metadata about the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
micro-partitions to avoid reading the ones that contain data that won't satisfy the filtering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
conditions. This focused approach minimizes unnecessary processing, leading to significantly

Clustering depth in Snowflake is a measure of how well the data within a table is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
organized based on its clustering key. A clustering depth of 1 signifies that, on average,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
each micro-partition in the table overlaps with only one other micro-partition, or, more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
technically, the average overlap is only 1. This doesn't mean the table has only one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
micro-partition (ruling out A), nor does it mean there are no micro-partitions (ruling out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
D). Instead, it describes the degree of overlap between micro-partitions. With a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
clustering depth of 1, there is overlap, but it is limited; the data is not perfectly colocated according to the clustering key. The goal of good clustering is to minimize                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
overlap. A clustering depth of 1 represents a somewhat poor clustering state as it's still                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
likely that queries will need to scan more micro-partitions than necessary, leading to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
less efficient query performance. A clustering depth of 0, which is what option C is

Option B, stating that the table has 1 overlapping micro-partition, is the most accurate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
interpretation of a clustering depth of 1. It doesn't imply a literal single overlap but

clustering depths, ideally closer to zero, are desired to optimize query performance by

A. Micro-partitioning requires a cluster key on a table.<br>B. Micro-partitioning is automatically performed on a table.<br>C. Micro-partitioning requires the use of the search optimization service.<br>D.

The correct answer is B. Micro-partitioning is automatically performed on a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake's architecture inherently incorporates micro-partitioning as a fundamental                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
data organization mechanism. This means users don't need to explicitly configure or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
define micro-partitions when creating tables. Unlike some database systems that

micro-partition management behind the scenes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Micro-partitions are small, contiguous units of storage (typically 50-500MB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
uncompressed) that Snowflake uses to store table data. As data is loaded into a table,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Snowflake automatically divides it into these micro-partitions based on various factors,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
including data ingestion order and size. This automatic process is crucial to Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
efficient performance and scalability. By storing data in small, self-describing units,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Snowflake can rapidly scan relevant subsets of data, reducing I/O operations and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
accelerating query execution. No user intervention is needed for this process; it’s a builtin feature. Options A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.

A. The data is pruned by column to eliminate unnecessary micro-partitions, then the rows within the remaining<br>B. The data is pruned by micro-partitions based on column values, then rows within the remaining micropartitions are filtered.<br>C. Any micro-partitions that are not needed for the query are pruned, then the data within the remaining micropartitions is pruned by column.<br>D. The data within micro-partitions is sorted by rows, then the columns are filtered based on the query

micro-partition to determine if it contains any data that could satisfy the query's filtering                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
criteria (WHERE clause). Micro-partitions that don't contain relevant data are entirely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
skipped (pruned) from the query execution plan. This significantly reduces the amount of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
data that needs to be scanned, resulting in faster query performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
After the irrelevant micro-partitions are pruned, Snowflake proceeds to filter the rows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
within the remaining micro-partitions based on the query's selection criteria. Because

characteristic contributes significantly to Snowflake's data consistency, performance,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and concurrency control. Immutability means that after a micro-partition is written to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
storage, its contents are never directly modified. Instead, updates or deletes result in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
new micro-partitions being created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
This immutability is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it enables efficient and reliable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
time travel. Because old versions of data are preserved in their original micro-partitions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
users can query historical data without impacting current workloads. Secondly, it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
simplifies concurrency control. Since micro-partitions are never modified in place,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
multiple queries can safely access the same data without needing complex locking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
mechanisms. Thirdly, immutability supports Snowflake's caching strategy. Once a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
micro-partition is cached, it remains valid unless explicitly evicted, improving query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
performance by minimizing disk I/O. Fourthly, it facilitates secure data sharing. Sharing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
data between accounts is simpler and safer because there's no risk of one account                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
corrupting data owned by another through in-place modifications. When data changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
are made, new micro-partitions will be generated containing the updated data and the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
previous micro-partition will still exist in its original form. The metadata layer tracks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
which micro-partitions are "active" for a given point in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option A is incorrect because micro-partitions are not directly exposed as files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake manages their storage internally. Option B is incorrect because while micropartitions contain metadata used for optimization, they are not themselves the index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake employs a metadata layer that provides sophisticated indexing capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
based on micro-partition characteristics. Option C is incorrect because micro-partition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
size is primarily influenced by data volume and internal optimization strategies, and is
