DataRobot is specifically designed as an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) platform. It allows users to

In contrast, Informatica is primarily an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data management tool. While                                                                                                           
Informatica can be used to prepare data for machine learning, it isn't fundamentally an ML platform itself.                                                                                                       
Power BI is a business intelligence and data visualization tool; it's used to analyze and report on data, not to

The correct command to list files in a user stage in Snowflake is LS @~. Here's why:                                                                                                                              
Snowflake uses stages to store files intended for data loading and unloading. User stages are personal                                                                                                            
storage locations associated with individual users. The tilde symbol (~) represents the current user's stage,                                                                                                     
while @ is the general operator for specifying a stage.                                                                                                                                                           
Option A, LIST @~;, is functionally similar to LS @~, and the result would be the same. However, LS is the                                                                                                        
specific command for listing files in a stage, and LIST is not the correct command in this context. LIST is used                                                                                                  
with other object types. Therefore, despite having the same result, it's less technically accurate.                                                                                                               
Option C, LS @usr;, is incorrect because it assumes a user stage named 'usr', while the current user's stage is                                                                                                   
referenced by @~. Finally, Option D, SHOW @%;, is incorrect as SHOW is not used for listing files within a

LS is a shorthand alias for LIST, specifically designed for quickly displaying files in a stage, improving                                                                                                        
readability and efficiency. While both could technically work in some contexts, LS is the established practice.                                                                                                   
Therefore, LS @~ is the most concise and accurate way to list files in the current user's stage within the

The correct answer is A. SnowCD (Snowflake Connectivity Diagnostic Tool) is specifically designed to
