The correct answer is C, the dollar sign ($). In Snowflake, user-defined variables are declared and referenced                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
using the dollar sign ($) prefix. This distinguishes them from column names and other SQL identifiers.

example, to declare a variable named my_variable and assign it the value 10, you would write SET my_variable                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
= 10; and then reference it in a query using $my_variable. The other options, @, &, and # are not used to denote                                                                                                                                                                                                               
user-defined variables in Snowflake's SQL syntax. The @ symbol is commonly associated with session                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
variables in some database systems, but in Snowflake, it's used for different purposes such as stage names or                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
user-defined variables scoped to stored procedures, it is not the primary symbol for user variables. The &                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
symbol is not associated with user variables or any similar functionality in Snowflake's SQL. The # symbol is                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
often associated with comments in SQL and some other programming languages but not user-defined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
variable declaration in Snowflake. User-defined variables are a valuable tool in Snowflake for improving SQL

A. The user must run the CALL command to execute the block.<br>B. The statements that define the block must also execute the block.<br>C. The SUBMIT command must run immediately after the block is defined<br>D. The block must be saved to a worksheet and executed using a connector.

The correct answer is B because Snowflake allows executing an anonymous block of code directly after its                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
definition without requiring separate commands like CALL or SUBMIT, nor saving it to a worksheet for later                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
execution. Anonymous blocks in Snowflake are defined using the BEGIN and END keywords (or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END), encapsulating a set of SQL statements. These statements are parsed and                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
executed as a single unit upon submission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option A is incorrect because the CALL command is typically used to execute stored procedures, not                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
anonymous blocks. Option C is incorrect, as there is no SUBMIT command related to anonymous block                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
execution in Snowflake. Option D is also incorrect; saving to a worksheet is one way to execute code, but not a                                                                                                                                                                                                                
requirement for anonymous blocks, and connectors are usually for external integrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The execution model of Snowflake emphasizes immediate processing of SQL commands. When an anonymous                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
block is submitted, Snowflake compiles and executes the code within the block immediately. Therefore, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
statements defining the block also inherently trigger its execution. The compilation and execution areimplicitly linked. This behavior contrasts with languages where you might define a function or block of code                                                                                                             
that needs to be invoked later via a separate command.

The correct SQL commands for constructing recursive queries in Snowflake, when the depth is unknown, are                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
CONNECT BY and WITH. The WITH clause, specifically when used with a common table expression (CTE)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
defined as RECURSIVE, allows for iterative processing, repeatedly referencing the CTE itself in the query                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
until a termination condition is met. This effectively handles situations where the number of recursion levels is                                                                                                                                                                                                              
unpredictable. The base case is defined in the non-recursive part of the CTE, and the recursive part processes                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
it until no more records satisfy the recursive criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
CONNECT BY is another approach, predominantly used in older database systems, but supported in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake. It uses hierarchical constructs to navigate through relational data, allowing for recursive queries

hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The LISTAGG function aggregates values but does not support the iterative behavior required for recursion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
MATCH RECOGNIZED is primarily used for pattern matching within a sequence of rows and isn’t suitable for                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
general recursive queries. QUALIFY filters the results of a window function; it is not useful for recursive                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
structures. Therefore, only CONNECT BY and WITH RECURSIVE fulfill the requirements of handling recursivequeries with variable depth in Snowflake.

The correct answer is C. REPEAT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
In Snowflake's SQL scripting, the REPEAT loop executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
condition becomes true. This means the loop body will run at least once, and then the condition is checked at                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the end of each iteration. The loop continues as long as the condition remains false. Once the condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
evaluates to true, the loop terminates. This behavior is fundamentally different from WHILE loops, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
check the condition before each iteration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
FOR loops typically iterate over a sequence or range, not based on a general true/false condition. LOOP is a                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
general, indefinite loop that requires manual break conditions, making it unsuitable for the specific "until true"                                                                                                                                                                                                             
requirement of the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The REPEAT ... UNTIL structure directly aligns with the prompt's "iterates until a condition is true"                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
requirement, making it the logical choice. WHILE loops, in contrast, execute while a condition is true, making                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
them unsuitable for this particular question's scenario. Therefore, REPEAT is the only loop construct among                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the options that fits the specific requirement of iterating until a condition becomes true.

The correct answer is B: When the procedure is defined to execute as CALLER. Snowflake stored procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
have two execution contexts: CALLER and OWNER. The execution context dictates whose privileges are used                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
and which environment is accessible within the procedure. When a procedure is defined as EXECUTE AS                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
CALLER, it runs with the privileges of the user who calls the procedure. Critically, it also inherits the session                                                                                                                                                                                                              
context, including any session variables set by that user. This means session variables are accessible directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                
within the procedure's code. Conversely, if a procedure is EXECUTE AS OWNER, it runs with the privileges of                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the procedure's owner, and the caller's session context and variables are not available.

as STRICT (option A) does not inherently affect access to session variables; STRICT mode governs data type                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and nullability rules. Similarly, while arguments (option D) can pass values, they are distinct from session                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
variables and do not allow a procedure to directly access session variables based on name and type similarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, option B is the only choice that directly relates to the availability of session variables within a

The correct answer is B (COMMIT) and E (ROLLBACK). Snowflake supports transactions, which allow multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
SQL statements to be grouped together and treated as a single unit of work. A transaction ensures either all                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
changes are applied successfully or none are, maintaining data consistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
COMMIT is a DML command that permanently saves all changes made within the current transaction to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
database. It finalizes the transaction and releases any locks held by it. A multiple statement request might                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
involve several INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements that only become effective when COMMIT is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
ROLLBACK is another DML command that undoes all changes made within the current transaction, reverting

If an error occurs during the processing of multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
statements or a decision to abort the operation is made, ROLLBACK ensures data integrity. Both COMMIT and                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
ROLLBACK are essential for managing transactional operations in a database system and thus support                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
multiple-statement requests for data access and updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Commands like CALL, GET, and PUT do not directly manage transaction boundaries. CALL is for invoking                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
stored procedures, GET is for downloading data from stages, and PUT is for uploading data to stages. While

manage their worksheets effectively. Users can further nest folders within other folders, enabling

B. Each worksheet is a unique Snowflake session: This is also correct. Each Snowsight worksheet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
operates within its independent Snowflake session. This ensures that actions and configurations

C. Users are limited to running only one query on a worksheet: This is incorrect. Snowsight allows

D. The Snowflake session ends when a user switches worksheets: This is also incorrect. When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
switching between worksheets, the active Snowflake session of the previous worksheet ispreserved. This is crucial for maintaining session-specific settings and allows users to return to a

E. Users can import worksheets and share them with other users: While users can copy and share                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
SQL code from worksheets, Snowsight does not directly support importing or exporting entire

The correct answer is B. LOOP. In Snowflake's procedural language, the LOOP construct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
represents an indefinite loop that will execute continuously unless explicitly terminated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
using a BREAK statement. Unlike FOR loops which iterate over a defined sequence, or

It executes its body repeatedly until a BREAK

Without a BREAK statement, the LOOP would become an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
infinite loop, consuming resources and likely causing problems. The BREAK keyword                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
serves as the primary means to interrupt the flow of execution within a LOOP, effectively
