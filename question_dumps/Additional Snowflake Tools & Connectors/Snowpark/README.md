A. Snowpark uses a Spark engine to generate optimized SQL query plans.<br>B. Snowpark automatically sets up Spark within Snowflake virtual warehouses.<br>C. Snowpark does not require that a separate cluster be running outside of Snowflake.<br>D. Snowpark allows users to run existing Spark code on virtual warehouses without the need to reconfigure the<br>E. Snowpark executes as much work as possible in the source databases for all operations including UserDefined Functions (UDFs).

Snowpark's core design principle is to push down as much computation as

This approach leverages the power of Snowflake's scalable compute

Option A is incorrect because Snowpark does not rely on Spark for query optimization. It utilizes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Snowflake's native query engine and its robust query optimizer. Option B is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Snowpark doesn't configure Spark within Snowflake. Its appeal stems from the fact that it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
removes the necessity for managing a separate system like Spark. Option D is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
while Snowpark supports Python, Java, and Scala, users cannot directly run Spark code without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
adapting it for the Snowpark framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Therefore, the key benefits of Snowpark are its ability to simplify infrastructure by eliminating
