This assertion acts as proof of successful authentication from the SSO provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake then uses this token to grant the user access, without ever seeing or handling the user's password

Federated Authentication in Snowflake, specifically, aims to centralize identity management, moving away                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
from Snowflake maintaining its own user credentials for every user. It achieves this by integrating with an

Snowflake, they are redirected to the IdP for authentication. The IdP verifies the user's credentials and then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
asserts their identity to Snowflake via Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OAuth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
This approach enables Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing users to access Snowflake using the same credentials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
they use for other enterprise applications governed by the IdP. This enhances security because password                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
policies and MFA are managed centrally at the IdP level. It also improves user experience by eliminating the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
need to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

simplifies user provisioning and de-provisioning since user access to Snowflake is controlled through the IdP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option A is incorrect because it doesn't necessarily disable other authentication methods, though they might                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
be configured to be less preferred. Option B is incorrect as Federated Authentication doesn't inherently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
enforce dual MFA, although MFA is often a feature of the integrated IdP. Option C is also incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Federated Authentication does not directly mandate the use of a secure network proxy. Instead, it focuses on

Federated authentication in Snowflake, which leverages external identity providers (IdPs) likeOkta or Azure AD, streamlines the user authentication process. It primarily handles the initiation

Snowflake-defined passwords. When federated authentication is enabled, it allows

However, Snowflake maintains its internal password-based authentication

Therefore, a user with a password created directly within Snowflake can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
still use that password to log in directly to Snowflake. The system doesn't enforce or
