The statement is false. Using SnowSQL or native connectors to interact with Snowflake does not inherently

Snowflake allows concurrent access from multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
interfaces without requiring explicit support intervention. Different client tools, such as SnowSQL,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
connectors, and the Web UI, leverage the same Snowflake backend infrastructure. These interfaces simply

The correct answer is D, "The role used to create the object." Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
In Snowflake's role-based access control (RBAC) model, object ownership is a crucial aspect of security and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
privilege management. When an object is created (e.g., a table, view, database), the role that was active at the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
time of creation becomes the owner of that object. This role inherently possesses all privileges on the object,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
including the ability to grant those privileges to other roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option A, "The user who created the object," is incorrect. Snowflake's access control revolves around roles,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
not individual users. A user must be associated with a role to perform any actions within Snowflake. The user's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
identity is secondary to the role they are using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option B, "The SYSADMIN role," is also incorrect. While the SYSADMIN role holds significant power within a

If the SYSADMIN role is active during object creation, then SYSADMIN becomes the

However, other roles might be used to create the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option C, "Ownership depends on the type of object," is misleading. While different object types have

consistent across all object types. The role used during creation determines the owner, irrespective of the

The significance of role-based ownership lies in its flexibility and control. By assigning ownership to roles,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Snowflake allows for separation of duties and centralized management of privileges. For example, a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
DATA_LOADER role could be used to create and manage tables for loading data, without granting individual

Therefore, the role actively used when the object is created becomes the owner and initially inherits allapplicable privileges on that object, which it can then delegate as needed.Snowflake Documentation on

The correct answer is A and D. The ACCOUNTADMIN role in Snowflake has the highest level of privileges,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
controlling the entire account. Therefore, its use should be carefully managed. Option A, requiring MultiFactor Authentication (MFA) for all users holding the ACCOUNTADMIN role, significantly enhances security                                                                                                                                                                                  
by adding an extra layer of verification beyond just a password. This mitigates the risk of unauthorized access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
due to compromised credentials, a critical security practice. Option D advocates for assigning the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
ACCOUNTADMIN role to at least two users, but as few as possible. Having at least two users ensures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
continuity and recovery in case one user is unavailable or experiences issues. However, minimizing the number                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
of ACCOUNTADMIN users reduces the potential attack surface and limits the risk of insider threats or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
accidental misuse of privileges. Options B, C, and E are not best practices. User ownership is not determined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
by the role granted, rather by the user’s creator, and having only one ACCOUNTADMIN user is a single point of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
failure. While SECURITYADMIN is important, it is not necessary for all users holding ACCOUNTADMIN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, combining MFA for all ACCOUNTADMIN users and maintaining a minimal but sufficient set of users

The correct answers are A and C. Snowflake implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, which is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
a standard security practice in database systems and cloud environments. RBAC simplifies user permission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
management by assigning roles with specific privileges to users, rather than assigning permissions directly to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
individual users. This allows for a more organized and efficient approach to controlling access to data and

Secondly,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Snowflake encrypts all data at rest and in transit. Encryption at rest protects data stored within Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
storage layer by rendering it unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys. Encryption in transit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
safeguards data during transfer between clients and Snowflake using protocols like TLS. This encryption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
ensures that data remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access, adhering to best practices in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
data protection and compliance. (See: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-encryption).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option B is incorrect as Snowflake does not require IAM users for database connectivity. Instead, users                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
authenticate directly using Snowflake-specific credentials or other supported methods like OAuth. Option D is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
also incorrect because Snowflake is a fully managed SaaS platform and does not run within a user's VPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Snowflake manages its infrastructure entirely. Option E is incorrect, while Snowflake compresses data to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
optimize storage and performance, it is not a mandatory aspect of security, and therefore is not as relevant in

The correct answer is B (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC) and E (Discretionary Access Control - DAC).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Snowflake employs a hybrid approach to access control combining these two models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Snowflake primarily uses RBAC. This involves assigning privileges to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
roles, and then assigning those roles to users. RBAC simplifies access management by grouping permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
based on job function. A user inherits the combined privileges of all roles assigned to them. For instance, a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
"Data Analyst" role might have SELECT privileges on certain tables, and assigning this role to a user grants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
them that access. This approach promotes consistency and reduces the risk of assigning incorrect privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
to individual users. RBAC is a widely adopted and crucial security practice in cloud

Discretionary Access Control (DAC): DAC means that object owners (typically the user who created the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
object) have significant control over who can access their objects. In Snowflake, the owner of a database,schema, or table, for example, can grant specific privileges (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) to other roles or                                                                                                                                                                             
users. This discretionary aspect allows for fine-grained control over data access at the individual object level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Although Snowflake emphasizes RBAC, DAC provides the flexibility for owners to customize access policies.

It's used for Single Sign-On (SSO), not for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
the internal access control model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
C. Identity Access Management (IAM): IAM is a broad term for managing digital identities and their access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
rights. RBAC and DAC are specific models within an IAM framework. While IAM is relevant, it's too general to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
be a specific component of Snowflake's access control model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
D. Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD): CRUD is a set of database operations; not an access control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
model. Permissions to perform CRUD operations are managed through RBAC and DAC in Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
F. Mandatory Access Control (MAC): MAC is a highly restrictive access control model where a central                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
authority determines access policies. It is not a feature of Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
In summary, Snowflake leverages RBAC for streamlined and consistent access management based on roles,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and DAC for object owners to customize access at a more granular level. This combination provides a robust

The correct answer is B. SECURITYADMIN and E. USERADMIN. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
SECURITYADMIN Role: The SECURITYADMIN role in Snowflake is specifically designed for managing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
security-related aspects, including user and role creation, granting and revoking privileges on roles, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
managing network policies. It's a higher-level security role focused on the overall security posture. A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
SECURITYADMIN can delegate the creation and management of users and roles to a USERADMIN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
USERADMIN Role: The USERADMIN role is explicitly designed to manage users and roles. This includes

granular role compared to SECURITYADMIN, focused solely on user and role management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
SYSADMIN Role: While SYSADMIN has broad privileges, including the ability to create and manage users and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
roles, it is not a recommended practice to use SYSADMIN solely for this purpose. Over-granting permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
violates the principle of least privilege.ACCOUNTADMIN Role: ACCOUNTADMIN is the most powerful role in Snowflake and should be reserved for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
critical account-level tasks, not routine user and role management. Granting this level of privilege solely for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
user/role management exposes unnecessary security risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
PUBLIC Role: PUBLIC is a default role granted to all users and roles. It doesn't have the privileges required to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
create or manage users and roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
In summary, SECURITYADMIN can delegate user and role management to USERADMIN. Therefore, using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
SECURITYADMIN and USERADMIN promotes a well-segregated and secure access control strategy.

The correct answer is A. USERADMIN. Here's why: In a new Snowflake account, the initial ACCOUNTADMIN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
user holds ultimate control. However, relying solely on one administrator poses a single point of failure and

Granting permissions to a role makes permissions management easier as it avoids granting permissions to

By using roles, updates to access permissions only need to be managed in one location

Forcing an immediate password change upon first login is a fundamental security best practice. It ensures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
that the initial, often system-generated password, which might be easily guessed or compromised, is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
immediately replaced with a strong, unique password known only to the user. This practice reduces the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
window of vulnerability and strengthens the security posture of the account. It aligns with the principle of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
least privilege and mitigates risks associated with default credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Setting a default role for a user is crucial for managing access control in Snowflake. Roles define the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
privileges a user has, determining what actions they can perform and what data they can access. Assigning a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
default role upon user creation ensures that users are immediately granted the appropriate permissions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
rather than requiring manual assignment every time. This practice simplifies user administration, enhances                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
security by limiting privileges to the necessary level, and adheres to the principle of least privilege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option A, configuring a user to be initially disabled, is not standard practice during the creation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Instead, users are typically enabled by default, though it's possible to disable them later.

The correct answer is A. Let's break down why. The ACCOUNTADMIN role in Snowflake is the most powerful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
role, effectively granting full control over the Snowflake account. It inherits all privileges and can perform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
virtually any operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
SHOW USERS allows ACCOUNTADMIN to list all users in the Snowflake account. This is crucial for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
administration and auditing. DESCRIBE USER allows ACCOUNTADMIN to view the detailed properties of a

This is important for

ALTER USER allows ACCOUNTADMIN to modify

USER allows ACCOUNTADMIN to permanently remove a user from the Snowflake account, which is essential                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
for security and user lifecycle management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they include commands that the ACCOUNTADMIN role doesn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
inherently have the right syntax to use directly on users. Specifically, "DEFINE users", "INDEX a given user,"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and "MODIFY a user" are not valid SQL commands in Snowflake for managing users. Moreover, while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
ACCOUNTADMIN can perform functions that effectively achieve similar results as "DEFINE" and "MODIFY,"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the direct syntax offered in the choices is not accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, only option A accurately reflects the commands that the ACCOUNTADMIN role can directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
execute on existing users in Snowflake. The ability to show, describe, alter, and drop users is fundamental tomanaging user access and security within a Snowflake environment.

ownership stems from best practices regarding security, separation of duties, and operational efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option B, "Create objects with SYSADMIN," is a recommended approach. The SYSADMIN role possesses the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
privileges to create and manage most objects within a Snowflake account. It serves as a suitable owner for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
many database objects, allowing for centralized management by a dedicated system administrator role,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
without granting the ultimate power held by ACCOUNTADMIN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option D, "Create objects with a custom role and grant this role to SYSADMIN," promotes a more granular and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
controlled approach to ownership. By creating a custom role specifically for owning certain database objects,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
you limit the scope of privileges associated with that ownership. Granting this custom role to SYSADMIN thenallows the SYSADMIN to manage these objects without needing the full ACCOUNTADMIN privilege set. This                                                                                                                                                                                  
strategy reinforces the principle of least privilege, a fundamental security concept where users or roles are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
granted only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This reduces the potential impact of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
security breaches or accidental misuse of privileges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option A is incorrect. While ACCOUNTADMIN has ultimate control, relying on it for all object ownership can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
create a single point of failure and doesn't promote separation of duties. Reassigning object ownership is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
sometimes necessary, and restricting this would hinder flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option C, "Create objects with SECURITYADMIN," is less ideal for general object ownership.

While they can create                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
objects, their focus is not on the day-to-day administration of database objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option E, "Use only managed access schemas for objects owned by ACCOUNTADMIN," is overly restrictive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Managed access schemas are useful, but they shouldn't be the only approach, and aren't directly related to

In summary, Snowflake recommends balancing centralized management (via SYSADMIN) with granular

The correct answer is D, Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Snowflake has native support for ABAC, a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
sophisticated data governance control that allows access to data objects based on attributes of the user, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
data, and the environment. This contrasts with more traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake's tag-based masking policies are a prime example of embedded ABAC. These policies determine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
data masking rules based on tags applied to columns and the attributes of the user requesting the data.

Network policies (A) control network access to Snowflake, but they are not attribute-driven, focusing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
primarily on IP address ranges or virtual networks. Credit computation (B) is related to Snowflake's resource                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
usage tracking and cost management, not data governance. Data storage (C) is about how Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
physically stores data, irrelevant to user authorization based on attributes. ABAC in Snowflake allows for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
more dynamic and context-aware access control than relying on predefined roles alone. This is particularly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
beneficial when dealing with sensitive data that requires a fine-grained access control mechanism.

A. They log all operations and enable fine-grained auditing.<br>B. They provide centralized privilege management with the schema owner.<br>C. They enforce identical privileges across all tables and views in a schema.<br>D. They require the use of masking and row access policies across every table and view in the schema.

access schemas in Snowflake streamline data governance by shifting privilege management from individual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
objects (tables, views) to the schema level. Instead of granting permissions on a granular basis for each                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
object, the schema owner controls all access rights within the schema. This simplifies administration and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
ensures consistency. When new objects are created in a managed access schema, they automatically inherit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
the access control rules defined by the schema owner, eliminating the need to manually configure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
permissions for each new item. This centralized model greatly reduces the risk of inconsistent permissions,

sensitivity of the data they hold. This categorization facilitates better understanding of the data landscape

This tagging system is the cornerstone for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
implementing a comprehensive data governance strategy, particularly concerning sensitive data. By tagging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
sensitive columns or tables with specific classifications (e.g., "PII," "PCI," "HIPAA"), organizations can track                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
and manage this data more effectively. This tracking facilitates compliance reporting, assists in data

and offers insights into resource usage by tracking the consumption of data classified as sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
While Comments (B) provide general notes, they lack the structure and searchability required for governance.

The correct answer is B. Only the user who generates the URL. Let's explore why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Snowflake scoped URLs, generated through functions like GET_PRESIGNED_URL, provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
temporary, secure access to files stored in Snowflake stages. The key characteristic of these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
URLs is their contextual security. This means the access rights are tied directly to the user who

The generated URL is essentially a signed request authorized on behalf of the

Option A, "Create an account for an organization," is correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
because the ORGADMIN role is indeed responsible for provisioning new Snowflake accounts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within the organization. This is a fundamental organizational management task. Option D, "View                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
usage information for all accounts in an organization," is also correct. The ORGADMIN needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
visibility into the resource consumption and spending across all accounts for monitoring and cost

This aligns with the concept of centralized organizational oversight and

Option B is incorrect, as editing account data is typically handled by the

The correct answer is A. No access. In Snowflake, and indeed in most secure cloud environments,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
a fundamental principle is the concept of "least privilege." This means that users and roles should                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
only have the minimum necessary access to perform their tasks. When a securable object, such as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
a database, table, view, or user, is created, it is not accessible by default. This ensures that data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and resources are protected and that access must be explicitly granted. If a default level of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
access, such as 'Read,' 'Write,' or 'Full' were granted by default, it would introduce a significant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
security risk as it would open the possibility of unintended or malicious access to sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake utilizes a role-based access control (RBAC) model, where privileges are granted to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
roles, and roles are assigned to users. Therefore, to access a newly created object, a user must                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
have a role with the necessary privileges granted to that role for that specific object, typically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
using the GRANT command. Only after explicit permissions are granted does a user or role gain

The correct answer is B. REVOKE ROLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
In Snowflake's role-based access control (RBAC) model, roles are granted to other roles or users                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
to manage permissions effectively. To remove a role from another role or user, the REVOKE ROLE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
command is used. This command explicitly revokes the granted privilege, meaning the target user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
or role will no longer inherit the permissions associated with the revoked role. The syntax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
generally follows: REVOKE ROLE <role_name> FROM ROLE | USER <role_name | user_name>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This action is critical for maintaining the principle of least privilege and ensuring that users and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
roles have only the necessary permissions to perform their duties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Option A, ALTER ROLE, is used to modify the properties of a role, such as renaming it, but not for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
revoking roles from users or other roles. Option C, USE ROLE, is used to switch the active role in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
the current session and does not affect role grants. Option D, USE SECONDARY ROLES, is used to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
specify roles used for authorization and does not have the functionality to revoke access. Hence,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the only command that handles the removal of a role from a user or another role is REVOKE ROLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
The REVOKE ROLE command is a fundamental component of maintaining a secure and wellmanaged Snowflake environment by controlling the access and permissions of users and roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Without the ability to revoke role privileges, organizations would face difficulties in implementing

Snowflake employs a hybrid access control model combining Discretionary Access Control (DAC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to secure data. DAC grants object owners direct control

RBAC, on the other hand, focuses on managing

The correct answer is B. Privilege. In Snowflake, a privilege represents a specific right to perform

example, the SELECT privilege allows querying data within a table, while the INSERT privilege

These privileges are fundamental building blocks for Snowflake's

systems, access to resources is determined by the owner of that resource, who has the discretion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
to grant or revoke access to other users or roles. This contrasts with other access control models                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
like Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where access is determined by system-wide policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Snowflake aligns with this DAC principle, where the object owner, typically the role that created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the object, controls who can access it. This ownership allows for fine-grained control over data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
and database objects. Option A describes a basic attribute of access control, not specifically DAC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option B describes a general principle of access control where an entity is granted access. Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
D describes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which is used by Snowflake in conjunction with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
DAC but doesn't define DAC itself. Snowflake uses RBAC for managing privileges assigned to

The correct answer is C, the schema owner. In Snowflake, a managed access schema

ownership of all new objects created inside it, regardless of who performs the creation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
action. This centralized control model enhances security and simplifies object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
management, allowing for more granular access permissions through role-based access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
control. This is because the OWNERSHIP privilege is not passed along to the creator.

The correct answer is B. Use a managed access schema. Here's the justification:

Option A, using a regular schema, does not enforce the desired restriction. The object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
owner in a regular schema retains the ability to grant privileges. Option C, a transient

Option D,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
setting the Default_DDL_Collation parameter, pertains to data sorting and collation, notuser privileges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, to limit privilege-granting capabilities to specific users, employing a managed

DAC grants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
object owners control over who can access their objects (e.g., tables, views). Owners can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
directly grant privileges to other users or roles. RBAC, conversely, manages access by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
assigning privileges to roles, and then granting those roles to users. This simplifies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
access management, especially in large organizations. Users inherit privileges assigned

While Snowflake uses Role-Based Access Control as the

Identity Access Management (IAM), which handles user identities and authentication, is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
not directly a security model for access control in this context, nor is Mandatory Access
