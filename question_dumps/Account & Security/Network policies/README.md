Here's a detailed justification for why options A and C are the correct choices for Snowflake network policies:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Snowflake network policies are a security feature that allows administrators to control network access to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
their Snowflake account. They operate by defining a list of allowed or blocked IP addresses, effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
creating a "whitelist" or "blacklist" for network connections. This mechanism is a fundamental aspect of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
network security in cloud environments, aligning with the principle of least privilege and perimeter defense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The use of IP whitelisting helps prevent unauthorized access attempts from unknown or untrusted networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option A is correct because network policies are not restricted to a specific Snowflake edition; they are a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
standard security feature available across all Snowflake editions. This broad availability enables all users to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
enhance the security posture of their Snowflake environments regardless of their chosen edition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Option C is also correct because the core functionality of a Snowflake network policy is to restrict or enable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
access based on specific IP addresses.

Role: Roles are primarily for managing access control to Snowflake objects and aren't directly related to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
network-level access control. While roles grant privileges, they don't define where connections originate.Hence, option A is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Schema: Schemas are organizational units within a database and do not deal with network access. They are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
logical groupings of tables, views, and other database objects. Therefore, option B is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
User: Network policies can be set at the user level, allowing specific users to be restricted to connecting only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
from certain IP addresses. This means you can enforce stricter access controls for sensitive user accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option C is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Database: Databases are containers for schemas and objects. They don't directly participate in network policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
enforcement. Databases are about data organization, not network access restrictions, so option D is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Account: Network policies can also be defined at the account level, applying the same policy to all users and

Roles, Databases, and Warehouses, however, are not directly associated with network policies. Roles are for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
access control and privileges within Snowflake. Databases store data and schemas, and Warehouses provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
the compute resources, but none of these directly relate to filtering network access based on IP addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The function of restricting database access based on network origin is handled through account-level policies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
or user-level policies that effectively control who can access these resources.

applied to those objects directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Therefore, only Users and Accounts are the Snowflake objects that you can directly apply a network policy.

While roles manage user privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
within the database, network policies dictate who can initially access the platform from outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Option D is incorrect: Network policies are not activated with ALTER DATABASE commands. They are

Here's the justification for why option D is the correct answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
In Snowflake, managing network policies requires specific privileges and ownership. A SECURITYADMIN role,

here is ownership. Option D states that the SECURITYADMIN needs ownership of both the user and the

This is consistent with Snowflake's security model, where actions are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
often governed by ownership, granting control over the objects being managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option A, the EXECUTE TASK privilege, is unrelated to network policies; it's specific to scheduling tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option B, a global ATTACH POLICY privilege, doesn't exist in Snowflake's permission model. The privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
related to network policies are object-specific, needing control over the object you intend to alter. Option C,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
ownership of the role that created the network policy, does not grant the ability to link the policy with a user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, for a SECURITYADMIN to activate a network policy for a specific user, they must have ownership                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
rights over both the user object and the network policy object. This ensures a granular control of who is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
allowed to make these associations. This ownership structure facilitates a robust security posture, allowing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
only authorized individuals to make changes that affect network access restrictions. It embodies the principle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
of least privilege, granting only the necessary rights for the task at hand.

The correct answer is B. Snowflake applies the BLOCKED_IP_LIST first. This is because Snowflake network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
policies prioritize blocking over allowing. When both ALLOWED_IP_LIST and BLOCKED_IP_LIST are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
configured, the system first checks if an incoming connection's IP address is present in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
BLOCKED_IP_LIST. If a match is found, the connection is immediately denied, regardless of whether the IP is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
also listed in ALLOWED_IP_LIST. This behavior is a crucial security principle of "deny by default" â€“ blocking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
access unless explicitly allowed. Effectively, the BLOCKED_IP_LIST acts as a higher precedence filter.

ensures that any known malicious or undesirable IP addresses are effectively prevented from accessing the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake environment, taking precedence over permissive rules. The ALLOWED_IP_LIST is only evaluated if                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
the IP address has not been found in the BLOCKED_IP_LIST. This mechanism helps maintain tight control over

The correct answer is indeed A, indicating that only one network policy can be active at the account level and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
a separate, single network policy can be active for a specific user at any given time.

policy functionality allows for granular control over network access by defining allowed or blocked IP address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
ranges. While you can define multiple network policies, only one can be associated with the account and only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
one with each individual user simultaneously. Applying more than one policy at the same level would create

takes precedence for that specific user. The concept of single active policy assignment is common in security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
and networking, designed for simple, consistent access rules to prevent accidental rule overlap or confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The assignment itself is done via ALTER ACCOUNT and ALTER USER statements, explicitly specifying the

Thus, an account or user cannot simultaneously use the access rules defined by two different                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
active network policies; that is, only one network policy is active per level.

The correct answer is indeed B, 5 minutes. Snowflake's session policies allow administrators to define session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
behavior, including idle timeout limits. Idle timeout refers to the duration a session can remain inactive before                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake automatically terminates it. This is a critical security feature, preventing unauthorized access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
through unattended sessions. While the platform allows for customization, there are minimum and maximumconfigurable values. Snowflake imposes a minimum idle timeout value of 5 minutes for session policies. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
limitation is inherent to the platform's design to ensure a balance between user convenience and security.

The correct answer is B: Those IP addresses are denied access to the Snowflake account as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake applies the blocked IP address list first. Snowflake's network policies control access

Network policies in Snowflake are primarily designed for security, focusing on controlling access

While Snowflake allows data sharing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
between accounts, this data transfer is not controlled at the network policy level; instead, it uses

The correct answer is D. SHOW NETWORK POLICIES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Here's why: Snowflake utilizes the SHOW command to list objects within its database

Specifically, SHOW NETWORK POLICIES is designed to retrieve a list of all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
network policies defined at the account level. These policies control network access to

policies, which manage session duration and parameters, and not network access rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Therefore, only SHOW NETWORK POLICIES (option D) serves the purpose of listing all

The correct options are B and C. Network policies in Snowflake control network access

account level. The SECURITYADMIN role is explicitly designed for this purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Therefore, option B is correct.

The correct answer is A. Network Policy. Network policies in Snowflake are designed to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
restrict access based on IP addresses. By specifying allowed IP ranges, administrators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
can effectively block connections originating from unauthorized or unknown locations,

encryption (B) primarily secures data in transit and at rest, not restricting access based                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
on location. While crucial for data security, it doesn't prevent unauthorized login                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
attempts from unknown sources. Multi-factor authentication (C) adds a layer of security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
after a user provides their credentials, but it doesn't prevent an initial login attempt from

An attacker with compromised credentials, but an unauthorized IP,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
could still attempt to login even with MFA if no network restrictions exist.
