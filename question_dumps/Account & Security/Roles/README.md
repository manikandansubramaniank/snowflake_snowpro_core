The correct answer is D. The assumed role that dropped the role. Snowflake's access control model is based                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
on roles, and object ownership is tied to roles, not users. When a role is dropped, its ownership of objects isn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
transferred to the user who executed the DROP ROLE command. Instead, Snowflake automatically transfers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
ownership of the objects to the role that was active when the DROP ROLE statement was executed.

typically the role that has privileges to drop other roles, often a system-level or higher-level custom role.

user who issues the drop command is not inherently linked to the ownership transfer; it's the active role at the

Therefore, the ownership is passed to the assumed role (i.e. the role that is in effect) when

The correct answer is False.

The correct answer is B, SYSADMIN.

Snowflake's role-based access control (RBAC) model emphasizes the principle of least privilege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
ACCOUNTADMIN is the most powerful role in Snowflake, essentially a superuser. Using it for routine tasks

The correct answer is B: Assign the custom role to the SYSADMIN role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Here's why: Custom roles in Snowflake provide a granular way to manage access control beyond the built-in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
system roles. The principle of least privilege dictates that users should only have the permissions necessary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
to perform their specific tasks. Creating custom roles allows administrators to tailor permissions to specific                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
job functions, enhancing security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Assigning a custom role directly to the SYSADMIN role, rather than a user, simplifies permission management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This approach allows SYSADMIN (or users granted the SYSADMIN role) to inherit the privileges associated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
with the custom role. This eliminates the need to individually grant the custom role to each user needing itsassociated privileges. It promotes efficient administration, especially when dealing with large numbers of

Option A is incorrect because while the SYSADMIN role can create custom roles, that doesn't constitute a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
"best practice" after the creation. Option C is incorrect because assigning the custom role to the PUBLIC role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
would essentially grant its permissions to all users, violating the principle of least privilege and potentially                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
introducing security vulnerabilities. Option D (adding _CUSTOM to role names) is a naming convention, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
is good for organization, but not a best practice relating to the assignment of the role after creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Assigning the custom role to SYSADMIN is a key step in leveraging custom roles effectively and efficiently.

In Snowflake, object ownership is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
hierarchical and tied to roles. When a role that owns objects (like tables) is dropped, the ownership of those                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
objects is transferred, not to a higher-level administrative role like ACCOUNTADMIN or SYSADMIN, but rather                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
to the role that performed the drop operation. This behavior is designed for accountability and control.

role executing the DROP ROLE command effectively becomes the new owner of the objects previously

The tables won't become orphaned or standalone; Snowflake ensures that

The correct answer is D because roles in Snowflake are primarily used for access control by granting and

Securable objects in Snowflake include databases, tables, schemas,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and other entities. Roles act as a central point for managing these permissions; a role is granted privileges,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and then users are assigned that role. This approach allows for efficient permission management by assigning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
roles to users rather than individual privileges. Option A is incorrect because roles can be granted to other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
roles, enabling hierarchical role structures. This allows for a system where a top-level role grants access and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
is distributed downwards. Option B is also wrong because system-defined roles, like ACCOUNTADMIN or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
SYSADMIN, cannot be dropped because they are essential for Snowflakeâ€™s operations. Option C is likewise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
incorrect since the privileges granted to system roles by Snowflake cannot be revoked, as these privileges are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
intrinsic to the function of these roles. In essence, roles in Snowflake offer a structured way to control access,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
promoting a separation of duties. The ability to grant and revoke privileges to roles is the defining                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
characteristic that makes them useful in a secure cloud data platform.

Option A is accurate because,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
during a connection attempt, if a specific role is provided and the user possesses the necessary privileges for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
that role, that role immediately becomes the active role for the session. This allows users to connect directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
using the required permissions for their work. Option B is also correct, because if no role is provided during                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
the connection, Snowflake will automatically default to the role set for the user. This mechanism ensures that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
the user still has the right permissions upon initial connection without needing to specify it in the connection

Option C is incorrect because, if no role is specified and no default role is set, Snowflake defaults to PUBLIC

Option D is incorrect, as a specified role that is not granted to the user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
will result in connection failure rather than falling back to the default role. Option E is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake will never auto-grant a role to a user for them to use it during a session.

This role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
is granted the necessary permission to set ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DATABASE_REPLICATION, enabling control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
over replication across accounts within the organization. Therefore, while ACCOUNTADMIN can do this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
ORGADMIN is the minimum required role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Consequently, ORGADMIN is the correct answer because it's the least privileged role authorized to set

The correct answer is A. Active role. In Snowflake, the active role of a user session dictates the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
privileges and permissions granted to that session. These privileges directly govern whichdatabases, tables, and other objects a user can see and the actions they can perform, such as
