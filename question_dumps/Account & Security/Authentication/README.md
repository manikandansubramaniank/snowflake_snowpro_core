<strong>B, D, E</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The correct answer is BDE. Snowflake supports several authentication methods, but not all listed options are                                                                                                                     
valid for user login.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Federated authentication (B) is a key method where Snowflake relies on a third-party identity provider (IdP)                                                                                                                     
like Okta or Azure AD to authenticate users. Instead of directly managing credentials, Snowflake trusts the                                                                                                                      
IdP to verify identities, thereby streamlining access control and enhancing security by enforcing companywide policies. This aligns with the principles of Single Sign-On (SSO), improving user experience and reducing          
password fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Key-pair authentication (D) utilizes cryptographic key pairs for secure access. A user generates a public and                                                                                                                    
private key; the public key is registered with their Snowflake user account, while the private key is used to                                                                                                                    
authenticate. This approach eliminates the need for passwords and is often used for automated processes or                                                                                                                       
secure programmatic access, furthering the concept of secure machine-to-machine communication.                                                                                                                                   
OAuth (E), an open standard for authorization, enables secure delegated access. Snowflake can leverage                                                                                                                           
OAuth to grant access to specific resources without needing user credentials directly. An OAuth client                                                                                                                           
obtains an access token after user consent, which it then uses to access Snowflake resources. This is crucial                                                                                                                    
for applications needing limited access on behalf of a user, adhering to the principle of least privilege access.                                                                                                                
Options A, C, and F are not valid user authentication methods for accessing Snowflake. SCIM (A) is a protocol                                                                                                                    
for managing user identities, not for logging in directly. TLS 1.2 (C) is a communication protocol that ensuressecure data transfer but not user authentication. OCSP (F) is a protocol for checking the revocation status of    
digital certificates and is not a method for a user to log into Snowflake.

Key pair authentication (D) is the correct answer because it provides a secure method for                                                                                                                                        
connecting to a Snowflake account. Instead of relying on passwords, key pair authentication uses                                                                                                                                 
a public key and a private key. The public key is stored in the Snowflake account, and the private                                                                                                                               
key is kept securely by the user. When logging in, Snowflake verifies the user's identity using the                                                                                                                              
private key, eliminating the risk of password-related vulnerabilities. Network policies (A) control                                                                                                                              
access based on IP addresses or network locations, not login credentials. SCIM (B) manages user                                                                                                                                  
and group identities, not the authentication process itself. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (C)

The correct answer is A and E, OAuth and username/password authentication. Snowflake's REST                                                                                                                                      
API primarily uses these methods for verifying the identity of clients attempting to access its                                                                                                                                  
services. OAuth allows secure delegated access, enabling applications to interact with Snowflake                                                                                                                                 
on behalf of a user without directly handling their credentials. A token is used instead of                                                                                                                                      
usernames and passwords, enhancing security and facilitating smoother integration with other                                                                                                                                     
platforms that support OAuth. Standard username/password authentication, on the other hand,                                                                                                                                      
directly leverages a user's login credentials to establish a connection. While a simpler approach,                                                                                                                               
it's less secure than OAuth and is generally more appropriate for direct user interactions. Key pair                                                                                                                             
authentication, while a robust method for some Snowflake operations, isn't the primary method                                                                                                                                    
for REST API. Multi-Factor Authentication, (MFA) works in conjunction with username/password,                                                                                                                                    
but it is not an independent authentication mechanism. Federated authentication, while pertinent                                                                                                                                 
to user login, doesn't directly impact the REST API's primary mechanisms; it relies on external                                                                                                                                  
identity providers to manage the login phase. Hence, OAuth and username/password are the two
