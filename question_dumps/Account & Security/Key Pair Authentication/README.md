The correct answer is A, Key pair authentication. Snowflake's Kafka connector primarily uses key pair                                                                                                                                               
authentication for secure and automated access. Key pair authentication involves using a private key to                                                                                                                                             
authenticate with Snowflake, eliminating the need for storing usernames and passwords within the Kafka                                                                                                                                              
connector configuration, which is a less secure practice. This enhances security by limiting the exposure of                                                                                                                                        
credentials. Instead of a user manually entering their details, the application uses cryptographic keys to                                                                                                                                          
establish trust with Snowflake. This is particularly useful in automated environments like data pipelines where                                                                                                                                     
human interaction isn't feasible. Key pair authentication leverages asymmetric cryptography principles, where                                                                                                                                       
the private key remains with the Kafka connector, and the corresponding public key is registered in                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake. This method aligns with best practices for secure cloud access. Other authentication methods like                                                                                                                                        
MFA, OAuth, and username/password are not the primary approach for the Kafka connector. MFA adds an                                                                                                                                                 
extra verification layer often not suitable for automated connections. OAuth, while a secure standard, is more                                                                                                                                      
common for user-based applications. Username and password authentication is less secure and not the                                                                                                                                                 
recommended practice for system-to-system integrations.

storing credentials directly. Similarly, Snowflake connectors, like the Python connector, utilize                                                                                                                                                   
key pair authentication for application-to-Snowflake interaction. This enables Python applications                                                                                                                                                  
to execute queries and manage data within Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake Marketplace, being a platform for data sharing, does not primarily use key-pair                                                                                                                                                           
authentication for accessing consumer listings. While listing providers might use such                                                                                                                                                              
authentication internally, it's not the central authentication method for accessing shared listings.                                                                                                                                                
SnowCDC, Snowflake's Change Data Capture service, focuses on managing data replication and

Therefore, the correct applications that would primarily benefit from key pair authentication are

The correct command to assign a key for Snowflake user key-pair authentication is

relies on a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key (kept secret by the user) and a public                                                                                                                                                        
key (shared with the server). Snowflake stores the user's public key and uses it to verify

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they attempt to set parameters that are notused for key-pair authentication in Snowflake. RSA_P8_KEY and ENCRYPTED_KEY are                                                                                
not recognized parameters for user settings related to key-pair authentication.                                                                                                                                                                     
RSA_PRIVATE_KEY should never be stored or transmitted to the server, it remains

to form an authenticating connection. Therefore, option D is the only suitable command

Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Key-pair authentication provides a significantly more secure and robust alternative to

eliminates these vulnerabilities by relying on cryptographic keys.                                                                                                                                                                                  
Specifically, key-pair authentication involves generating a public and a private key. The                                                                                                                                                           
public key is stored within the Snowflake service account. The third-party application                                                                                                                                                              
uses the corresponding private key to authenticate. The private key should be stored                                                                                                                                                                
securely and never shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Compared to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), key-pair authentication is better suited                                                                                                                                                             
for service accounts used by applications. MFA typically involves human interaction for                                                                                                                                                             
the second factor, which isn't practical for automated processes.                                                                                                                                                                                   
While Single Sign-On (SSO) offers centralized identity management, it usually involves a

communication between a service account and a third-party application. SSO often                                                                                                                                                                    
requires a human user to authenticate initially.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
In contrast, key-pair authentication allows for secure, automated authentication without
