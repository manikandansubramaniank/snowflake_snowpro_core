Which of the following statements are true of Snowflake releases: (Choose two.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
A. They happen approximately weekly<br>B. They roll up and release approximately monthly, but customers can request early release application<br>C. During a release, new customer requests/queries/connections transparently move over to the newer version<br>D. A customer is assigned a 30 minute window (that can be moved anytime within a week) during which the

The correct answer is AC. Let's break down why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option A is Correct: Snowflake employs a frequent release cadence, pushing out new features and fixes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
roughly on a weekly basis. This agile approach allows for rapid iteration and improvement of the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
These updates, being frequent, often focus on minor enhancements or bug fixes rather than major feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
overhauls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option C is Correct: A key characteristic of Snowflake's service architecture is its seamless and transparent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
upgrades. During a release, user sessions and queries are automatically migrated to the newer version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
without any manual intervention required from the customer. This ensures continuous availability and minimal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
disruption to operations. Snowflake achieves this through its sophisticated architecture which supports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
rolling upgrades and manages connections gracefully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option B is Incorrect: While Snowflake does roll up releases, it doesn't happen on a monthly basis. Monthly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
roll-ups are not the standard procedure. Furthermore, while early access to features is often an option, that is

update method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option D is Incorrect: Snowflake's upgrades are designed to be zero-downtime. Customers do not experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
system unavailability windows, let alone assigned ones. The rolling update process manages the migration to
