The correct answer is A, External Tokenization. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
External Tokenization is a process where sensitive data is replaced with a non-sensitive equivalent (a token)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
before the data ever reaches the Snowflake environment. This happens outside of Snowflake, usually through                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
a third-party tokenization service. This is crucial for protecting data before it's loaded, mitigating the risk of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
unauthorized access during the ingestion process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The other options are not suitable for pre-ingestion data masking. External Tables simply reference data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
stored outside of Snowflake; they don't inherently tokenize it.

within Snowflake based on existing data; they operate on data after it's loaded and are not designed for preingestion masking. User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs) allow custom logic to be applied to data, but they                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
operate within Snowflake; they can be used for data transformations, but are not the preferred method for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
tokenizing data before ingestion. Tokenizing the data externally ensures that the raw sensitive data is never

The correct answer is C because periodic rekeying of encrypted data enhances security by regularly rotating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
the encryption keys used to protect data at rest. This mitigates the risk associated with key compromise, as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
even if a key is exposed, it's only valid for a limited period.

The correct answer is C. Before it is sent from the user's machine. When using the PUT command in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake, data encryption occurs client-side, meaning before the data leaves the user's machine. This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
critical for ensuring data security during transit. Snowflake utilizes end-to-end encryption. The PUT command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
first encrypts the data using a temporary key before sending it over the network to the Snowflake internal

The correct answer is D. SNOWFLAKE_FULL. Let's examine why and explore the concepts involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Client-side encryption, in this context, means that data is encrypted before it's sent to Snowflake, ensuring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
that Snowflake itself never has access to the unencrypted data.

The correct answer is B and C. Snowflake implements encryption at rest for all data, and this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
encryption happens automatically at two key points during the data loading process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option B, "After loading the data into a table," is correct because once data is inserted into a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Snowflake table, it's immediately encrypted by Snowflake's encryption services. This ensures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
that data stored within Snowflake's managed storage is always protected. This is part of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Snowflake's built-in security and requires no action from the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option C, "After loading the data into an internal stage," is also correct. When data is staged                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within Snowflake using an internal stage (a storage location managed by Snowflake), it's
