The Information Schema specifically tracks details about database objects and their underlying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Databases are containers for schemas, tables, views, and other objects. The Information Schema provides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
details about the size of databases, creation timestamps, and other metadata useful for management and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Internal stages, used to store data files within Snowflake's internal storage, also have storage information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
tracked by the Information Schema. This includes information about the files stored in the stage, their sizes,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
and access details. This allows users to monitor storage utilization within Snowflake and manage their data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
more effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Users and Resource Monitors, while important Snowflake constructs, don't directly relate to storage in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
way that databases and stages do. User information is primarily about access and permissions, and is stored in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
different metadata views. Resource monitors track credit usage, not the physical storage footprint of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Pipes are related to data ingestion, but the Information Schema provides details about the storage of the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
ingested, not the Pipes themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, databases and internal stages are the two object types for which the Information Schema directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
provides storage information, making options B and C the correct answer.

Before you can get detailed storage metrics for individual tables, you need a list of tables in a database and

This command will give you a list of tables for which you can then query the

Let's address why the other options are incorrect:

C.Information Schema -> TABLE_HISTORY: While TABLE_HISTORY provides information about changes to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
tables over time (e.g., creation, alteration, deletion), it does not provide information on the storage used byeach table. It's focused on auditing and tracking table modifications, not storage consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
D.Information Schema -> TABLE_FUNCTION: TABLE_FUNCTION within the Information Schema lists the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
table functions, not storage metrics. Table functions are used to process data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
In summary, to monitor the data storage for individual tables, you'd first list the tables (SHOW TABLES) and

E. Identification of who has read data: ACCESS_HISTORY tracks which users or roles have accessed specific                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
data objects. This is crucial for auditing and compliance purposes. Knowing who has read sensitive data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
enables you to monitor for potential security breaches or unauthorized access, and to implement appropriate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
security measures. This is central to data governance and security best practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Now let's consider why the other options are less suitable:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
B. Identification of which roles have been used: While ACCESS_HISTORY indirectly shows which roles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
accessed data, it primarily focuses on data access, not role usage itself. Role usage is better tracked using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
other auditing features specific to role management.

Tracking of network policy usage: Network policies control network access to Snowflake, but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
ACCESS_HISTORY doesn't directly track which network policies were in effect during specific data access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
events. This would require separate auditing of network policy activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
D. Highlighting of row access policy usage: While ACCESS_HISTORY might indirectly show the effect of a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
row access policy by showing which data was accessed, it's not designed to highlight usage of the policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
itself. It shows data accessed subject to the policy, not the policy being used. Furthermore, the effect can't be

In summary, ACCESS_HISTORY is primarily a data access log. Its primary use is to identify patterns related to

Option C: "Account usage views contain dropped objects but information schema views do not." This is

Account Usage views, designed for historical analysis and auditing, retain information about objects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
even after they've been dropped. This allows administrators to track object lifecycles and understand past                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
activity. Information Schema views, on the other hand, are essentially "live" representations of the current                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
state of a database or schema. Once an object is dropped, it's no longer reflected in the Information Schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option D: "Data retention for account usage views is 1 year but is 7 days to 6 months for information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
schema views, depending on the view." This highlights a crucial difference. Account Usage views maintain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
data for a considerably longer period (1 year), providing a comprehensive historical record for analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Information Schema views have a much shorter data retention period, ranging from 7 days to 6 months,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
because they focus on providing a real-time snapshot of the database's structure. This shorter retentionperiod is appropriate as their main purpose is metadata access rather than long-term historical analysis.

Option A: "No active warehouse is needed to query account usage views but one is needed to query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
information schema views." While Account Usage views do operate differently, you do need an active                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
warehouse to query both types of views. The distinction lies more in how they are structured and their purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
rather than the requirement for an active warehouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option B: "Account usage views do not contain data about tables but information schema views do." This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
false. Account Usage views do contain information about tables, including creation times, drop times, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
usage statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option E: "Information schema views are read-only but account usage views are not." Both Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Schema views and Account Usage views are read-only. You cannot modify the data through these views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
In summary, the key difference between these two view types comes down to their intended use: Account

This is because the command is not scoped to a single Snowflake account, instead requiring access

The principle of least privilege dictates that only the role needing access to a

ACCOUNT_USAGE views is not within this range. This retention period can vary, and the maximum period is

The correct answer is A and D. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA within a Snowflake database provides a readonly view into the metadata of objects within that specific database. This is crucial for understanding the

Option A is correct because it reflects that the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
INFORMATION_SCHEMA primarily exposes metadata through pre-built views. These views are specific to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
objects residing within the database in which the schema is located. On the other hand, option B is incorrect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
because INFORMATION_SCHEMA is not account-wide but localized to each database. Option C is partially                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
correct but requires clarification. While Snowflake does store historical and usage data, it isn't provided within

That data is accessed using different account-level views and table

Option D is accurate because Snowflake makes specific historical and usage information

These functions are available account-wide, and thus are not part of any single database's

Consequently, option E is incorrect as the scope of INFORMATION_SCHEMA is

the most suitable:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
A. SHOW TABLES command: While SHOW TABLES lists tables, it doesn't offer detailed storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
metrics. It primarily provides information like table names, creation dates, and types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
B. SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES command: This command is specifically for external tables, not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
regular Snowflake tables. Thus, it's irrelevant to the question's focus on individual table storage

C. TABLES view: The TABLES view in the Information Schema provides metadata about tables,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
such as their structure and properties. However, it does not include the comprehensive, granular

Thus, the TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS view within                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
ACCOUNT_USAGE does not provide the most recent information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY view in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA primarily tracks

valuable insights into past storage consumption, it isn't focused on immediate tablelevel details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Finally, a data share's TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS view reflects the storage usage fromthe provider's perspective, not the consumer's, and is irrelevant in this context as we're

ACCESS_HISTORY serves this purpose specifically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Therefore, to track read and write operations performed on a table, ACCESS_HISTORY is
