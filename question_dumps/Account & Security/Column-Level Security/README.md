The correct answer is B. Use dynamic data masking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Dynamic data masking in Snowflake allows for the selective obscuring of data at query runtime, based on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
role or privileges of the user executing the query. This precisely addresses the requirement of making                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
sensitive data invisible to end users while revealing a partial view to functional managers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option A, data encryption, secures data at rest and in transit, preventing unauthorized access to the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
underlying data files, but it doesn't control what is displayed to different users when querying the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option C, secure materialized views, could potentially provide different views of the data. However, managing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
numerous views for various access levels can be complex and might not be the most efficient solution for this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
scenario. Furthermore, if the underlying table has sensitive data visible to managers via the materialized view,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
it could be indirectly revealed to end-users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option D, revoking all roles, would prevent both managers and end-users from accessing the data, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
contradicts the requirement for managers to have partial visibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Dynamic data masking is the most suitable solution because it allows administrators to define policies that

They allow you to define rules that redact, substitute, or obfuscate data based on the role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
or user accessing it. This directly addresses the requirement of allowing some users to see the full PII while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
limiting others. For example, you can create a masking policy that shows the full Social Security Number                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
(SSN) to HR personnel but masks it for customer service representatives, displaying only the last four digits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Row access policies (A) restrict access to rows in a table based on user attributes or roles. While useful for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
overall data access control, they don't provide the granularity to selectively mask portions of a column's data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
They would either allow a user to see the entire row (including the PII) or prevent them from seeing it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Data encryption (C) protects data at rest and in transit but doesn't control user-level access to specific parts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
of the data. Even with encrypted data, users with appropriate permissions would still see the full, unmaskedPII. Encryption protects against unauthorized access to data at a storage level, not selective display of data to                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
authorized users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Role-based access control (RBAC) (D) is fundamental for managing permissions in Snowflake, but it's not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
granular enough to achieve the required data masking. RBAC grants or revokes access to objects like tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
and views, but it doesn't inherently allow for selective masking of data within a column based on the user's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
role. It's a component of data security, but it's not the feature providing granular control over PII visibility as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
requested in the question. It may be combined with data masking policies for comprehensive data security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Therefore, data masking policies provide the targeted solution for selectively displaying PII based on user

Masking policies in Snowflake are primarily designed to control data access at the column level within tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
and views. They dynamically mask sensitive data based on the context of the query, such as the role or user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
executing the query. Option A, materialized views, correctly identifies a valid object for masking policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Since materialized views are essentially stored query results, applying a masking policy ensures that data is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
masked at the view level, effectively controlling what information is visible to users. Option C, tables, is also a

Stored procedures (B), streams (D),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
pipes (E), and UDFs (F) do not hold data directly; they are procedural logic or data processing constructs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
While these can interact with masked data, the masking policies themselves are not applied to these objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Therefore, the correct options are A and C, highlighting the core function of masking policies to secure data

Will the developer be able to modify the table to read the masked data?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
A. Yes, because a table owner has full control and can unset masking policies.<br>B. Yes, because masking policies only apply to cloned tables.<br>C. No, because masking policies must always reference specific access roles.<br>D. No, because ownership of a table does not include the ability to change masking policies.

Here's a detailed justification for why option D is the correct answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake's security model separates data ownership from data access control.

The correct answer is B. Dynamic Data Masking and C. External Tokenization. These two features directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
contribute to column-level security in Snowflake. Dynamic Data Masking allows for the obfuscation of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
sensitive data in columns based on user roles or contexts. This means that users with insufficient privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
will see masked or altered data, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected without altering the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
underlying stored data. For example, a user might see only the last four digits of a credit card number instead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
of the full value.

A. The secure view is only available to end users with the corresponding SECURE_ACCESS property.<br>B. End users are unable to see the view definition, and internal optimizations differ with a secure view.<br>C. With a secure view, the underlying data is replicated to a separate storage layer with enhanced encryption.<br>D. Secure views support additional functionality that is not supported for standard views, such as column

The correct answer is B because secure views in Snowflake provide an added layer of data protection by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
concealing the underlying query logic from users who are granted access to the view. Unlike standard views,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
where users can view the definition, secure views prevent this exposure. This is critical for protecting sensitive

Also, Snowflake employs internal

A tag isn't the

limitation lies in how masking policies are applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Masking policies are associated directly with a column of a table, view, or external table. You can't directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
attach a masking policy to a tag. However, a tag can help you locate which columns to apply a policy to. For                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
example, you might have a tag called "PII" that's applied to columns containing personally identifiable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
information. Then, you'd create a masking policy and assign it to each column identified by that tag. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
essential part is that a single column can have, at most, one masking policy applied at a time, specific to each                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
data type it holds. This is to avoid conflicting masking rules and ensures data integrity and predictability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, if you have multiple columns tagged with "PII" that hold different data types (e.g., string and date),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
you could apply a single string masking policy to all relevant string type columns, and a date masking policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
to date columns, but a given string column can have only one string policy. This reinforces the correctness of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
option B: A tag can have only one masking policy for each data type. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
a tag is a metadata object and it does not directly inherit or influence the masking policy application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
constraints. There is no relationship between dropping a tag and its association with a policy. Also, a given                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
column (not tag) can only have one masking policy of a given type applied, and that is regardless of any tags.

The correct command to implement a pre-existing masking policy in Snowflake is ALTER TABLE

While the option APPLY

Therefore, option B is incorrect and should not be confused with the method used to

it's a clause used within the context of altering tables or views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Here's the breakdown: Snowflake's masking policies are defined objects, separate from the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
they affect. Once created, these policies must be associated with specific columns of tables or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
views. This association is achieved using the ALTER TABLE or ALTER VIEW statement, and the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
SET MASKING POLICY clause specifies which policy is to be applied to which column. This means,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
you are altering the structure of an existing database object to incorporate the policy defined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
elsewhere. The masking policy will be active only when this alteration process has taken place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for reusable policy definitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
across multiple database objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
To illustrate, a typical command might look like this: ALTER TABLE your_table MODIFY COLUMN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
your_column SET MASKING POLICY your_masking_policy;. Therefore, the process involves first                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
creating a policy (using CREATE MASKING POLICY), then applying that policy to a column in a

The correct answer is D. Schema Â» Table Â» Column. Tag inheritance in Snowflake follows a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
hierarchical pattern where tags applied at a higher level in the hierarchy are inherited by objects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
nested within it. This concept is similar to inheritance patterns in object-oriented programming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Tags applied to a schema are inherited by all tables within that schema. Subsequently, tags on a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
table are inherited by all columns within the table. This inheritance mechanism streamlines tag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
management and ensures consistency, minimizing repetitive tag assignments.

"Organization Â» Account Â» Role," is incorrect. While organization and accounts are hierarchical,roles donâ€™t inherit tags from them; roles have their own taggable properties. Option B, "Account Â»                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
User Â» Schema," is also incorrect as users donâ€™t inherit tags from accounts, and schemas, while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
related to accounts, are not nested within users. Option C, "Database Â» View Â» Column," is

Access History, while crucial for auditing, primarily tracks who accessed what object,

Column-level security,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
through features like masking and row-level security, controls access to data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
preventing reads, not necessarily logging them. Object dependencies show how objects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
are linked, not how access to the data within them is handled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, data classification is the key first step. Once sensitive columns are identified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
via classification, downstream auditing processes can then use this metadata to track

It acts as a

answer because the masking policy definition is stored as a schema-level object, like

You create a masking policy within a specific schema, and that policy is

This means that while the policy is housed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
within a schema's namespace, its purpose is directly related to controlling access to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
column data. Option A, "Table," is incorrect because masking policies are not directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
created at the table level; instead, they apply to columns within a table. Option D,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
"Database," is incorrect because the scope of masking policy definitions is not at the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
database level; it's within schemas inside databases. Option B, "Column", is also                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
technically incorrect because the masking policy definition exists as a schema object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
and then applied to a column, not created directly against a column.

Here's a detailed justification for why option D, Tag-based masking policies, is thecorrect answer in the context of column-level security in Snowflake:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Column-level security in Snowflake focuses on controlling access to specific columns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
within a table. It aims to protect sensitive data at a granular level. Tag-based masking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
policies offer a powerful way to achieve this. Masking policies determine how data is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
displayed to users based on their roles or privileges. These policies can redact, hash, or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
partially mask data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Tag-based masking policies are particularly advantageous because they allow you to

When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
a user queries a column with an applied masking policy, Snowflake evaluates the tag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
associated with that column and applies the corresponding masking rule based on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
user's roles and the conditions defined in the policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option A, Object tagging, is the mechanism by which we associate tags with columns,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and therefore important, but it doesn't directly enforce column-level security. It's a

Option B, Data classification, is related to understanding the sensitivity of data, but it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
doesn't directly implement access control. It's more of a prerequisite to using columnlevel security effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Option C, External tokenization, is another data protection technique, but typically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
applies at a different level and is not inherently integrated into Snowflake's columnlevel security features. While it can complement masking policies, it is not the primary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
supported feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, Tag-based masking policies leverage the power of object tagging to
