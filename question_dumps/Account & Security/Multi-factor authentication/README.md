The correct answer is ABCDE, meaning all listed connectors – JDBC, SnowSQL, Snowflake Web Interface (UI),

Snowflake. MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond just a username and password, requiring                                                                                                                                                                                                      
users to provide a second verification factor, typically from a mobile app, hardware token, or email. Thisgreatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Snowflake, as a cloud data                                                                                        
platform, prioritizes security, and therefore, integrates MFA support across all its official client interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                            
JDBC and ODBC are standard database connectivity technologies, and Snowflake’s implementations of these                                                                                                                                                                                                     
support MFA. SnowSQL, Snowflake’s command-line client, similarly supports MFA. The Snowflake web                                                                                                                                                                                                            
interface, which serves as a browser-based client, also enforces MFA configurations as set in the account.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Finally, Snowflake's Python connector, which allows programmatic interaction with the platform, is also                                                                                                                                                                                                     
capable of handling MFA. The mechanism for MFA will vary slightly, but the ultimate outcome of requiring                                                                                                                                                                                                    
multiple factors to establish a secure connection remains consistent across all the connectors. This universal                                                                                                                                                                                              
implementation of MFA underscores the platform's commitment to securing data access.

The ACCOUNTADMIN role in Snowflake is the most powerful, possessing complete control                                                                                                                                                                                                     
over the entire account, including user management, resource provisioning, and data access policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Therefore, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for users with this role is crucial to safeguard

It serves as a critical additional layer of security                                                                                                                                                                                                  
beyond just a username and password, requiring a secondary verification method such as a mobile app code,                                                                                                                                                                                                   
significantly reducing the risk of account breaches. While roles like SECURITYADMIN and SYSADMIN also                                                                                                                                                                                                       
have high privileges, the ACCOUNTADMIN role’s overarching control makes its protection the utmost priority.                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Mandating MFA for ACCOUNTADMIN aligns with best practices in cloud security, reinforcing the principle of                                                                                                                                                                                                   
least privilege and limiting the blast radius of a potential compromise. While MFA is beneficial for all users, its

The statement that MFA in Snowflake is only supported with SSO is false. Snowflake natively supports MFA                                                                                                                                                                                                    
independent of SSO. While SSO provides centralized authentication and can leverage MFA solutions,                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Snowflake's own MFA implementation works directly within the Snowflake platform. Users can enable MFA                                                                                                                                                                                                       
using methods like Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile without configuring SSO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake's built-in MFA is a security feature that enhances user authentication by requiring users to provide                                                                                                                                                                                              
an additional verification factor besides their password. This added layer of protection mitigates the risk of                                                                                                                                                                                              
unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. This native MFA implementation uses time-based, onetime passwords (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app.                                                                                                                                             
SSO is a different authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple applications with a single                                                                                                                                                                                                 
set of credentials. Integrating Snowflake with an SSO provider can streamline login processes and centralize                                                                                                                                                                                                
user management. While SSO can be configured to enforce MFA through the SSO provider, it's not a                                                                                                                                                                                                            
prerequisite for using MFA in Snowflake. Snowflake's own MFA capabilities can function without SSO,                                                                                                                                                                                                         
providing a separate means of enhanced security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Therefore, the independence of Snowflake's native MFA from SSO configurations is a crucial point to

Organizations can choose to implement MFA using either Snowflake's built-in feature or through

The correct answer is D. MFA is an integrated Snowflake feature. This is because Snowflake directly                                                                                                                                                                                                         
provides the functionality for Multi-Factor Authentication within its platform. This means it's not an external                                                                                                                                                                                             
service but a built-in capability. Snowflake accounts and user management handles the implementation and                                                                                                                                                                                                    
management of MFA. Option A is incorrect because MFA is not applied to roles, but rather to individual users.                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option B is incorrect since users are not automatically enrolled in MFA by default; they must be enabled,                                                                                                                                                                                                   
usually by an account administrator. Option C is incorrect because users manage their MFA settings directly                                                                                                                                                                                                 
within Snowflake, and do not need to submit a support request to Snowflake. This feature enhances security                                                                                                                                                                                                  
by requiring users to provide multiple verification factors in addition to a username and password. Typical                                                                                                                                                                                                 
MFA methods include email codes, authenticator apps, or physical security keys. By integrating MFA,                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake ensures a more robust and secure access control mechanism, aligning with industry best practices

Snowflake, it allows clients to cache Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) tokens, reducing the frequency of

This caching mechanism is crucial for improving user experience and streamlining                                                                                                                                                                                                            
authentication processes, especially for frequently accessing users. The cached token's validity period is

After this duration, the client must undergo a new MFA challenge to generate a fresh

This time-limited approach is a security best practice that balances convenience with the need to                                                                                                                                                                                                    
periodically re-validate user identity, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access using a compromised token.                                                                                                                                                                                               
Longer caching periods could increase the vulnerability window, while shorter ones might negate the benefits

It's essential to understand that this

Enhanced authentication in Snowflake focuses on strengthening the process of verifying a user's identity                                                                                                                                                                                                    
beyond basic username and password combinations. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), option C,                                                                                                                                                                                                               
accomplishes this by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as a password and a code                                                                                                                                                                                               
from an authenticator app. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access resulting from                                                                                                                                                                                                        
compromised credentials. Federated authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO), option D, enhance security by                                                                                                                                                                                                   
delegating authentication to a trusted identity provider (IdP). This allows users to log in to Snowflake using                                                                                                                                                                                              
their existing organizational credentials, centralizing identity management and improving user experience                                                                                                                                                                                                   
while also improving security by allowing for enforcement of policies at the identity provider level. Snowflakemanaged keys (A) are primarily for data encryption, not user authentication. Object-level access control (B)                                                                                 
governs what users can do after they've authenticated, not the authentication process itself. Thus, only MFA                                                                                                                                                                                                
and Federated authentication/SSO directly address and enhance the initial login authentication process.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Enhanced authentication methods are vital in cloud security as they mitigate threats such as phishing and

The correct answer is A, Duo Security. Snowflake integrates directly with Duo Security as a builtin feature to provide enhanced MFA. While Snowflake supports various identity providers for

incorporated as an integrated MFA solution, not just as an external provider. This integration                                                                                                                                                                                                              
means that Duo’s MFA capabilities are tightly woven into the Snowflake platform’s security

The correct answer is A and D. User preferences in Snowsight, Snowflake's web interface, allow

Users can configure MFA methods associated with their user profile                                                                                                            
to enhance the security of their access to Snowflake. This is standard practice in cloud security to

Option D, Notifications, enables users to control
