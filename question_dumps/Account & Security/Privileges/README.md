A. The GLOBAL privilege CREATE TASK is required to create a new task.<br>B. Tasks are created at the Application level and can only be created by the Account Admin role.<br>C. Many Snowflake DDLs are metadata operations only, and CREATE TASK DDL can be executed without virtual<br>D. The role must have access to the target schema and the CREATE TASK privilege on the schema itself.

The correct answer is D, stating that the role must have access to the target schema and the CREATE TASK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
privilege on that specific schema to create a task. This is because in Snowflake, tasks, similar to other schema                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
objects, are scoped to a particular schema. Creating a task necessitates not only the general ability to create                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
tasks but also the authorization to do so within the chosen schema. Option A is incorrect; the CREATE TASK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
privilege is not a global privilege but rather a schema-level privilege. Option B is incorrect as tasks are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
created at the Application level and do not solely require the ACCOUNTADMIN role. Any role with the required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
access to the schema, and the schema-level privilege can create the task. Option C is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
although many Snowflake DDL operations can be metadata-only, the CREATE TASK command requires                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
warehouse resources and is subject to privilege requirements. The creation of a task does not execute a query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
that needs a warehouse but the task is associated with a warehouse for executing queries later. In summary,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the authorization model in Snowflake emphasizes granular control, hence privileges like CREATE TASK are

The correct answer is C. SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE. This SQL command is specifically designed to display the

SHOW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
GRANTS ON ROLE is not a valid command syntax in Snowflake. SHOW ROLES lists all roles in the system,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
not their associated privileges. SHOW GRANTS FOR ROLE is also an invalid syntax. Snowflake employs rolebased access control (RBAC), where roles are assigned privileges, and users are assigned roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Understanding the privileges granted to a role is crucial for managing security and access within a Snowflake

Using SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE <role_name> provides a clear view of a role's permissions,

The OWNERSHIP privilege on a table grants the user full control over it, including                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the ability to alter its properties, such as enabling or disabling search optimization. This privilege is the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
highest level of control a user can have on an object. It aligns with the fundamental principle of least privilege,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
as a user should only have the permissions needed to perform their required actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION privilege on the schema is also necessary. Snowflake's security model is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
hierarchical; schema privileges govern the objects within them. In order to add search optimization to a table,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
you need the necessary right on the schema containing that table. Therefore, the user must have the ADD

within the schema and database where it will reside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option A correctly grants the MYROLE to the user USER1 using GRANT ROLE MYROLE TO USER USER1;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This step allows the user to assume the privileges associated with MYROLE.

MATERIALIZED VIEW ON SCHEMA MYDB.MYSCHEMA TO ROLE MYROLE; designates that only users using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
the MYROLE role can create materialized views in the specified schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Option B attempts to grant the privilege directly to USER1 instead of a role, which is incorrect in Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
role-based access control system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option C is invalid because directly granting schema-level create privileges to a user without specifying ROLE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
is not supported in the Snowflake's CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW syntax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option D is problematic because although it does grant role to the user, the view creation grants the access to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
a specific role (MYROLE) and not the user itself, therefore, the user cannot create the materialised view unless                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
the user currently working under the assigned role (MYROLE) which is not specified in the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, answer A follows Snowflake’s standard practice of assigning privileges to roles rather than                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
directly to users and correctly uses the syntax for assigning privileges to a role for the ability to create                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
materialized views on a schema.

The correct answer is D, REFERENCE_USAGE on databases. Snowflake secure views, when shared, need

This privilege doesn't provide access to the data itself; it only enables the referencing

The correct answer is C, granting the MANAGE GRANTS global privilege, because it allows a user to modify                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
grants on any object within the Snowflake account, including new objects created in a managed access

Managed access schemas, also known as grantor's rights schemas, centralize privilege management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Traditionally, the owner of an object grants privileges on it. With managed access schemas, the schema owner

To change permissions (grants) for new objects within a managed access schema, a user needs the authority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
to override the default schema owner's control. OWNERSHIP (option A & B) allows a user to drop the object orreplace it, not necessarily modify the permissions for others. Granting ALL privileges on the schema (option D)

The correct answer is A. show grants to user USER1;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Let's analyze why. Snowflake, like most database systems, uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
managing permissions. Roles are granted to users, and those roles confer specific privileges. To see the roles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
granted to a user, we need a command that displays these granted roles, and this is precisely what show                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
grants to user <user_name>; accomplishes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option B, show grants user USER1;, is syntactically incorrect in Snowflake. It lacks the crucial to keyword,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
indicating where the grants are being applied, therefore, this command will return an error in snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option C, describe user USER1;, provides details about the user itself, such as creation date, password details,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
and other properties, but it does not show the roles granted. This command only describes the characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
of user object and not its access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option D, show grants on user USER1;, is incorrect for Snowflake. While the intention might be clear,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Snowflake uses the to keyword to specify that we are looking for grants given to a user. Using on here implies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
we would be examining what permissions a user has on user object itself, not granted roles to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The show grants command in Snowflake is specifically designed to display information about granted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
privileges, including roles. By adding to user USER1, the command directs Snowflake to filter and return only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
the roles granted directly to the user named 'USER1'. Thus, option A is the only option that correctly and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
completely addresses the problem statement.

distinct from simply using the warehouse for queries (USAGE) or monitoring its activity (MONITOR).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Specifically, when a warehouse is suspended and its auto-resume feature is disabled, someone with the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
OPERATE privilege is needed to explicitly bring it back online. The USAGE privilege only allows querying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
within the warehouse, but not altering its state. MONITOR allows you to check the warehouse's status but not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
change it. MODIFY, on the other hand, is used to alter configuration aspects of the warehouse.

warehouse is a direct operational task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The OPERATE privilege is fundamental for managing warehouse lifecycle and is essential for scenarios where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
manual intervention is necessary to bring a warehouse out of a suspended state. This contrasts with autoresume which removes that need but is not relevant in this question, where we are focusing specifically on a                                                                                                                                                                                                         
scenario when auto-resume is off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Therefore, the OPERATE privilege is the most appropriate privilege for a role required to resume a suspended

The correct answer is B, Role. Snowflake's access control framework primarily uses roles to grant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
permissions. Permissions, like the ability to read a table's data (SELECT privilege), are granted to roles, not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
directly to users. A user then assumes a role to gain those permissions. This separation of privileges from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
individual users promotes better security management and auditability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Granting permissions to roles allows for easier management of user access. Instead of assigning permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
individually to each user, you assign permissions to a role and then grant that role to multiple users.

approach simplifies administration, especially in large organizations with many users and evolving access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
requirements. Changes to access control only need to be made at the role level, rather than for each

Resource monitors in Snowflake track credit usage. Managing them requires specific privileges beyond

resource monitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The MONITOR privilege is essential to view the definition and settings of a resource monitor. Without it, a user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
cannot inspect the current configuration, including credit quotas, notification thresholds, and the associated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
warehouse. Essentially, it grants read access to the resource monitor's metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The MODIFY privilege is crucial for altering the resource monitor's properties. This includes changing thecredit quota, adjusting notification thresholds, suspending the associated warehouse, or setting a new start                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and end timestamp. Without the MODIFY privilege, you can see the monitor, but you cannot make any

The ALTER privilege, while frequently used in database management systems for changing objects, is not

The DROP privilege would permit you to drop or delete the resource

Therefore, viewing a resource monitor's definition necessitates the MONITOR privilege, and altering its

The correct answer is C. USAGE. To understand why, let's delve into Snowflake's privilege model and how it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
applies to external stages and REST APIs for accessing unstructured data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Snowflake's access control is based on roles and privileges. When an external stage is created, it acts as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
pointer to the external location (like S3 or Azure Blob Storage). Simply having an external stage defined isn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
enough; you need privileges to use that stage. The USAGE privilege, specifically, grants the right to use an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
object, including an external stage. This means a role with USAGE can interact with the stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Now, regarding the GET REST API for unstructured data files, the API operation requires a valid stage

The correct answer is C. Grant the additional privileges to the SYSADMIN role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake strongly advises against directly modifying system-defined roles like ACCOUNTADMIN. These                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
roles are designed with specific, fundamental responsibilities and changing them can lead to unforeseen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
security and administrative challenges. Instead, best practice dictates granting additional privileges via                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
custom roles or the SYSADMIN role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
While custom roles are suitable for most user-specific privilege sets, the scenario explicitly mentions adding

Let's break                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
down why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
In Snowflake, object ownership grants comprehensive control, including the power to restore a dropped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
version. The owner inherently possesses the right to manage the object's lifecycle, including recovery from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
deletion. This stems from the principle of least privilege, where only the designated owner should possess                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
ultimate control. Granting ownership signifies a high level of responsibility and authority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The UNDROP privilege is specifically required to execute the UNDROP command, which is the mechanism for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
restoring a dropped object. While ownership grants the right, the UNDROP privilege allows the user to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
actually perform the action. It's a separate privilege because sometimes the object owner might want to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
delegate the restoration task without transferring the complete ownership rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
UPDATE, MODIFY, and CREATE are not relevant to restoration. UPDATE is for modifying data within tables,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
MODIFY is for altering object structures, and CREATE is for establishing new objects. These operations don't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
involve recovery of a dropped object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Therefore, having both OWNERSHIP and the UNDROP privilege on an object enables a user to restore it

The correct answer is D. IMPORTED PRIVILEGES.

Marketplace, users need specific privileges that allow them to access and utilize shared data. IMPORTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
PRIVILEGES is the privilege that grants a user the ability to consume data shared through a Snowflake share,which is how data listings on the Marketplace are distributed. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they                                                                                                                                                                                                    
relate to different operations. CREATE DATA EXCHANGE LISTING (A) is for creating listings, not consuming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
them. CREATE SHARE (B) is for creating shares to distribute data. While related to data sharing, CREATE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
SHARE is not what's needed to consume data. IMPORT SHARE (C) is not a valid Snowflake privilege.

IMPORTED PRIVILEGES effectively allows a user to "subscribe" to a share                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
and access the shared data. Without this privilege, the user cannot see or access the data in the share,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
rendering the Snowflake Marketplace listing inaccessible. This is a crucial aspect of data governance and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
security within the platform, ensuring that only authorized users can access shared data. This aligns with the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
broader cloud computing concept of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions for users to

Snowflake’s documentation explicitly confirms this requirement.

The correct answer is C, SYSADMIN. In Snowflake, the SYSADMIN role is designed to be the system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
administrator role and holds significant privileges across the entire account. This includes the power to create                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
tables and views, which are foundational objects in a database. The SYSADMIN role inherits the privileges of

The correct answer is B. OWNERSHIP. A secure view in Snowflake, like standard views, is a database object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
that acts as a virtual table representing the results of a query. However, secure views have an additional layer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
of access control: they are only exposed to users who have the OWNERSHIP privilege on the secure view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
itself. This is distinct from standard views where the USAGE privilege on the underlying objects (tables, views)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
grants users the ability to query the view.

OWNERSHIP privilege specifically granted on it. This design prevents users from accessing sensitive data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
contained within a secure view if they don't have the explicit ownership permissions. This also helps to follow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the principle of least privilege by restricting view access only to those who need it and preventing others from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
even seeing that the view exists. Importantly, secure views do not affect the underlying object’s permissions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
therefore the correct choice is Ownership and not References. Therefore, the OWNERSHIP privilege is the key

The correct answer is C. GRANT ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON SCHEMA TO ROLE. Let's break down                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
why. Snowflake's search optimization service enhances query performance by creating optimized search                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
access paths. This optimization occurs at the table level, but the privilege granting happens at a schema level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The privilege 'ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION' specifically grants the ability to add search optimization to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
tables within a schema. Option A, 'GRANT SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON SCHEMA TO ROLE', is incorrect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
because while it seems related, it doesn't encompass the "add" function needed to initiate the service. It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
might control access to metadata about existing search optimization, but it won't allow the user to start                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
adding the optimization. Similarly, options B and D, which involve the database level, are incorrect because the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
granularity of search optimization control is at the schema level. Snowflake doesn't offer the privilege to add                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
search optimization at the database level directly. Therefore, the privilege 'GRANT ADD SEARCH                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
OPTIMIZATION ON SCHEMA TO ROLE' explicitly provides the required permission to enable search

This granular approach ensures proper access control and

To clarify, the 'ADD' keyword is crucial in this scenario as it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
implies creating a new search optimization structure, not simply accessing or managing an existing one.

Without this privilege, the consumer cannot instantiate their own view of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
shared data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
IMPORT SHARE: The IMPORT SHARE privilege is crucial because it grants the consumer the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
authorization to access and utilize a specific share that has been made available on the Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Exchange by the provider. This privilege is not related to objects within a database but rather it

privilege acts as the gatekeeper for data access from a specific provider through the Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Exchange. It is required for a consumer to view and interact with the shares made available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
through the Data Exchange. Without this privilege, the consumer cannot access the available

E. USAGE: The USAGE privilege is necessary to access objects within a database, such as tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
or views. While needed after a database is created from a share, it is not the initial privilege to

The ACCOUNTADMIN role in Snowflake holds the

This includes the ability to perform all tasks,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
including the creation and management of data shares. Data sharing is a core feature ofSnowflake that allows users to securely share databases, schemas, and tables with other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake accounts. Managing this critical functionality requires top-tier permissions. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
SECURITYADMIN role, while possessing crucial security responsibilities, does not automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
have the authority to create and manage shares. Similarly, SYSADMIN and USERADMIN roles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
have specific administrative focuses but lack the necessary scope for data sharing management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
at the account level. The principle of least privilege dictates that only the highest authority, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
ACCOUNTADMIN, should manage resources as fundamental as data shares. Giving these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
privileges to other roles would violate this principle and could pose a potential security risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Therefore, by default, only ACCOUNTADMIN can manage data shares, enforcing robust access

Let's analyze the roles and permissions within Snowflake's managed access schemas. Managed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
access schemas centralize privilege management, differing from regular schemas where the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
object owner has broad control. In this context, the schema owner (A) plays a key role as they                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
retain the ability to grant privileges on the objects within their schema to other roles. Crucially,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
this capability is not automatically extended to object owners in managed schemas. Furthermore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the role possessing the MANAGE GRANTS privilege (D) has the explicit power to grant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
permissions, irrespective of object ownership. The ORGADMIN (B) and USERADMIN (C) system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
roles possess broad administrative control but are not directly responsible for granting object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
privileges within a specific managed schema. Their power lies in overall governance, such as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
creating users, roles, and databases, not the fine-grained control of schema access. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the schema owner and roles with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege are the two entities capable of

Snowflake's role-based access control (RBAC) model implements a hierarchical structure, where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
roles can be granted to other roles, forming a tree-like structure. When a role is granted to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
another, the granting role becomes the parent and the granted role becomes the child within thehierarchy. In Snowflake, privileges granted to a role are not automatically inherited by all roles

means a child role inherits the privileges of its direct parent role. It also does not mean that a role

If a user needs more access, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
solution is to assign the user one of the parent roles which inherit all of the lower level roles

To interact with them, specific privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
are needed. The SELECT privilege (Option A) is for reading data from tables or views, not for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
managing resource monitor objects, so it is incorrect. Ownership (Option B) grants full control,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
including modification and deletion. While sufficient, it's not the least privilege required. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
USAGE privilege (Option E) is typically for using database objects like warehouses or schemas,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
not for directly managing resource monitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The MONITOR privilege (Option C) allows a user to view the resource monitors and their                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
configuration. This means users can see the monitor's settings and current consumption without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
altering them. The MODIFY privilege (Option D) grants the ability to change the resource monitor'ssettings, like limits and notification thresholds. Thus, the least privileges necessary to both view                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and modify resource monitors are indeed MONITOR and MODIFY. Using these, you can view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
configuration and change it as needed, without needing full OWNERSHIP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege, a critical security concept in cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
computing that minimizes risk by granting only the permissions needed to perform a task. Overprivileging creates potential security vulnerabilities and unnecessary risks of accidental                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
modification or deletion. This ensures that permissions are assigned correctly for each user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
function, increasing security for the database and its configurations.

This is because the USAGE

It doesn't directly grant permission to the underlying cloud storage; Snowflake manages

permissions required on the actual cloud storage are separate.While READ permission might seem relevant for reading file content, it's not applicable at the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake object level. Similarly, MODIFY is for altering the stage's properties or its location, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
SELECT is relevant to accessing data inside Snowflake tables not external files. To put simply,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
USAGE allows Snowflake to know which storage location it can access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Think of the external stage as a doorway to your external cloud storage. The USAGE privilege                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
gives the Snowflake user the key to that door to look through it and see the files available but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
doesn't grant access to the files themselves. Instead, Snowflake handles access to files via

Snowflake's access control model is designed so that privilege on objects is distinct from actual

The correct answer is A, the object owner. In Snowflake, the principle of least privilege is central                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
to security. Object privileges, such as SELECT or INSERT on a table, are fundamentally controlled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
by the entity that owns that specific object. This owner, typically the user or role that created the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
object, has inherent rights, including the authority to grant privileges to other users or roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
While schema owners can create objects within a schema, they do not automatically control the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
privileges on those objects.

The correct answer is B. DELETE. The OVERWRITE option within an INSERT statement in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake functions by implicitly deleting existing data in the target table before                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
inserting new records. This action requires the role executing the INSERT statement to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
possess the DELETE privilege on that specific table. The OVERWRITE functionality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
essentially combines a DELETE operation followed by an INSERT. Without the DELETE

While TRUNCATE can also remove all data from a table, it requires a

The correct answer is A. GRANT and E. CREATE USER. Let's break down why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In Snowflake, managing users involves controlling their access and permissions. The

The CREATE USER privilege, as its name suggests, is absolutely necessary to create

This privilege is granted to roles, which, when assignedto a user, enables them to create new users within the Snowflake account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The other options are incorrect because they lack the inherent ability to manage users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
SELECT is a privilege for querying data, MODIFY is for changing data within tables, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
OWNERSHIP allows for full control of a specific object, not necessarily management of

User management requires controlling access and

The correct answer is C. OWNERSHIP. In Snowflake, the OWNERSHIP privilege is unique                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
and critical because it dictates complete control over an object. Unlike other privileges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
like MONITOR or OPERATE, OWNERSHIP grants the ability to perform all actions on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
object, including granting further privileges, altering its structure, and even dropping it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Importantly, once OWNERSHIP is granted from one role to another, it cannot be revoked                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
directly. The recipient of OWNERSHIP then has full authority over the object, effectively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
becoming the new owner. The previous owner no longer has inherent control unless the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
new owner explicitly grants privileges back. This behavior ensures that there is a single,

The correct answer is C and D. When sharing data in Snowflake, providers grant access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
to consumers through shares. Shares themselves don't directly grant access; instead,

access data in a share, a provider needs to grant specific privileges.

Specifically, you must have ownership of the user object because activating a network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
policy for a user essentially modifies the user's properties to associate them with that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
policy. You also need ownership of the network policy because applying the policy to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
user requires modifying the policy's configuration to associate it with the user.

ownership of both objects, you lack the necessary permissions to establish the link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
between the user and the policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option A is incorrect because ATTACH POLICY is a global privilege that applies to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
session policies, not network policies and not necessarily to individual users. Option B is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
wrong because CREATE SESSION POLICY allows you to create session policies but does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
not provide the rights to apply network policies to users. Option C is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
CREATE NETWORK POLICY permits the creation of network policies, but it does not

privilege on both the user and the network policy grants the complete authority required
