Temporary tables in Snowflake are specifically designed to exist only within the scope of a single session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
When the session ends, the temporary table and all its data are automatically dropped. This behavior is in                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
stark contrast to other table types like permanent or transient tables which persist beyond individual

The temporary table's limited lifespan makes them ideal for storing intermediate results or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
temporary data that's not required for long-term storage. These tables are session-specific and not visible to                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
other sessions, ensuring data isolation. The ephemeral nature of temporary tables avoids the need for manual                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
cleanup, simplifying data management within individual work sessions. They can be created and manipulated                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within a session just like any other table but their scope remains confined to the initiating session. They are                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
essentially a workspace for session-specific operations. Transient tables, on the other hand, while not as                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
permanent as permanent tables, do survive session termination. They don't have the session-specificrestriction that defines temporary tables, making 'A' the most appropriate answer.

types in Snowflake, each offering distinct characteristics concerning data persistence and availability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Permanent tables are the standard table type, designed for long-term data storage.

Temporary tables in Snowflake are designed for short-lived data storage within a user's session. They offer

permanent tables, temporary tables do not incur Fail-safe costs because data recovery is not a consideration

Transient tables also

A user needs to MINIMIZE the cost of large tables that are used to store transitory data.

The correct answer is B. Transient. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Transient tables in Snowflake are designed for data that's not critical for long-term storage and doesn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
require the same level of data protection as permanent tables. The key characteristic of transient tables is                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
their lack of fail-safe protection. This means that if a failure occurs, data stored in a transient table is not                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
recoverable by Snowflake's fail-safe mechanism. Because the user has stated that data is recoverable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
elsewhere, this lack of fail-safe is acceptable. The advantage is that they do not incur the costs associated

Additionally, the undrop feature of permanent

Permanent tables, while offering the highest level of data durability and recovery via fail-safe, are not suitable                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
for the stated requirements due to their higher storage costs and fail-safe maintenance overhead.

External tables are used to access data stored outsideSnowflake, and are not applicable in this scenario where tables are being used to store data within Snowflake.                                                                                                                   
Therefore, transient tables are the most cost-effective option for transitory data that doesn't require fail-safe

The correct answer is A. Temporary. Temporary tables in Snowflake are designed for session-specific datastorage and manipulation. They exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from other table types. A                                                                                                                
key feature of temporary tables is their limited visibility; they are exclusively accessible to the user who                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
created them. This isolation ensures that data within these tables remains private and does not interfere with                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
other users or processes. Furthermore, temporary tables can share the same name as permanent tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
within the same schema, a flexibility not found with other table types, as the session-specific context                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
prevents naming conflicts. Crucially, temporary tables are automatically dropped when the user session ends,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
which makes them suitable for storing intermediate results, data transformations, or any data not required                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
beyond the scope of a single session. Local tables are not a recognized table type in Snowflake. User tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
are a concept, but they are actually permanent tables owned by a specific user. Transient tables are

Okay, let's break down why options B and E are the correct characteristics of transient tables in Snowflake,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
and why the others are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Transient tables in Snowflake are designed for temporary data storage, prioritizing cost-effectiveness over                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
data persistence and recovery. Unlike permanent tables, they do not have a Fail-safe period. This means that                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
once dropped, they are not recoverable through Snowflake's Fail-safe mechanism. This eliminates option A as                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
transient tables do not have a 7 day failsafe period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Option B is correct. Transient tables can be cloned into permanent tables. This is a useful feature when you                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
need to preserve data from a transient table for longer-term storage or analysis, effectively promoting it from                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
temporary to permanent status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Option C is incorrect. While transient tables persist until explicitly dropped, this is not unique to transient                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
tables. Both permanent and transient tables persist until explicitly dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option D is incorrect as transient tables cannot be altered to become permanent tables. You would have tocreate a new permanent table and move data into it if you wanted to switch.                                                                                                                                                 
Option E is correct. Transient tables have a significantly shorter Time Travel retention period compared to

Temporary tables in Snowflake are designed for short-lived data, typically within a single session. They don't

temporary tables during data transformations, you avoid accumulating storage charges associated with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
persistent data. This differs from permanent tables that incur storage costs for as long as they exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Transient tables are similar to temporary in that they do not have fail-safe, but can persist beyond a session                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and therefore incur longer storage costs.

Temporary tables in Snowflake are designed for short-term data storage during a session or

Their key advantage in ETL workflows is that they do not persist beyond the session,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
meaning they are automatically dropped once the session ends. This eliminates the need for

The correct answer is D and E: Temporary and Transient tables.

are designed for managing costs associated with short-lived data. Temporary tables exist only

Time Travel and Fail-safe. External tables do not store data within Snowflake, but rather access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
data in external locations. Shared tables are used for data sharing, not cost management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Therefore, temporary and transient tables provide a cost-effective solution for short-lived data

Transient tablesare designed to be used when they do not need the same protections as permanent tables.

A. The temporary table will take precedence over the permanent table.<br>B. The permanent table will take precedence over the temporary table.<br>C. An error will say there cannot be two tables with the same name in a schema.<br>D. The table that was created most recently will take precedence over the older table.

The correct answer is A: The temporary table will take precedence over the permanent table.When a permanent table and a temporary table share the same name within the same schema in                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake, the temporary table effectively "masks" the permanent table for the current session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
This behavior is a core aspect of Snowflake's session-based temporary object management. When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
a query, SELECT * FROM TBL1;, is executed, Snowflake first looks for an object named TBL1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within the scope of the user's current session. If a temporary table named TBL1 exists within that

The underlying permanent table,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
while still existing, becomes inaccessible under the name TBL1 within that same session. If no                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
temporary table named TBL1 existed in the session, the query would access the permanent table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This priority helps users conduct operations with temporary data without needing to change the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
schema or impacting permanent data; the temporary table provides a session-scoped sandbox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The key idea is the scope: the temporary table is specific to the session and is accessed first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Here's a breakdown of why other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
B. The permanent table will take precedence over the temporary table: This is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflakeâ€™s resolution logic prioritizes session-specific temporary tables over permanent tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
when naming conflicts arise within the same schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
C. An error will say there cannot be two tables with the same name in a schema: Snowflake allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
both a temporary and permanent table with the same name in the same schema; they are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
distinguished by session scope and access precedence. This means that no error will occur during                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
object creation. The precedence is also an important behavior that Snowflake is built upon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
D. The table that was created most recently will take precedence over the older table: While that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
is a characteristic of some other system, it is not how Snowflake deals with temporary and

The precedence rule is specifically about session scope and the priority

What do temporary and transient tables have in common in Snowflake?

A. Both tables have no Fail-safe period.<br>B. Both tables have data retention period maximums of one day.<br>C. Both tables are visible only to a single user session.<br>D. For both tables, the retention period ends when the tables are dropped.<br>E. For both tables, the retention period does not end when the session ends.

Fail-safe provides a 7-day recovery window after a table is dropped, but this safety net is

Temporary tables are intended for very short-term use within a single user session. They are

Here's a detailed justification for why the correct answer is D. Transient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Transient tables in Snowflake are designed for data that needs to persist beyond a session but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
does not require the same level of long-term protection as permanent tables. They are explicitly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
created by a user and remain until explicitly dropped using a DROP TABLE command. They are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
accessible to all users with the necessary privileges, irrespective of their individual session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Critically, unlike permanent tables, transient tables do not have a Fail-safe period. This means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
that once they're dropped, the data is immediately unrecoverable by Snowflake's fail-safe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
mechanism, which makes data recovery more manual using other external recovery methods.External tables reference data stored outside of Snowflake, making option A incorrect as the                                                                                                                                                  
persistence of data depends on where that external data is stored.

The correct answer is D. ALTER. Snowflake external tables are read-only structures that

RENAME operations are not supported. You cannot insert data into the external storage

Similarly, renaming a table (the Snowflakedefined view) isn't the main consideration; rather the physical name is that of the stored

The primary purpose of external tables is to query data in place without requiring data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
loading. However, you can modify the metadata of the external table to reflect changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
in the external storage or for other organizational needs. The ALTER TABLE command inSnowflake provides this functionality, allowing you to adjust properties like the file                                                                                                                                                          
format, location, or refresh the metadata if the external files have changed. Specifically,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
the ALTER TABLE statement can be used to refresh the metadata associated with the

These are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
directly impacting the underlying data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Join operations (option B) are indeed possible with external tables, allowing you to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
combine their data with data from regular Snowflake tables. However, the question asks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
for operations that can be performed on the external table itself. Therefore, JOIN is an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
operation performed with an external table, not on it. Hence, ALTER is the most                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
appropriate choice as it directly modifies the definition of the external table.

The correct answer is C, Transient table. Transient tables in Snowflake are specifically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
designed for data that can be readily regenerated from external sources, making them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
ideal for scenarios where persistence is not a primary concern. Unlike permanent tables,
