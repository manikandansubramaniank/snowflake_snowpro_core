The correct answer is B, 7 days. Snowflake's fail-safe feature is a critical component of its data protection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
strategy, acting as a safety net in case of accidental data loss. Fail-safe provides a non-configurable,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
guaranteed period for data recovery after the standard time travel window. Unlike time travel, which allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
you to query and restore historical data for a user-configurable period (up to 90 days for enterprise edition),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
fail-safe is solely for Snowflake's internal recovery and is not directly accessible by users. During the 7-day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
fail-safe period, Snowflake maintains the data, even if it is dropped or modified beyond the time travel

If needed, Snowflake's support team can utilize fail-safe to recover the data on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
customer's behalf if a significant data loss event occurs. This ensures a last line of defense, minimizing the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
risk of permanent data loss. It's essential to understand that fail-safe has associated costs and is included in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
storage costs for your Snowflake account, despite not being directly accessible. Time travel allows users to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
revert changes within the specified retention period, while fail-safe is a secondary mechanism, automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
taking over once the time travel window expires. In essence, fail-safe is an infrastructure level backup by

The correct answer is B. Data expires from Fail-safe. Here's why: Snowflake's data storage cost model is tied                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
to the actual storage used, even for data that appears to be deleted. When data is removed from a table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
(through DELETE or TRUNCATE operations), it's not immediately purged. Instead, Snowflake retains this data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
for a specific period, governed by Time Travel and Fail-safe. Time Travel allows users to recover data within a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
defined period (up to 90 days for Enterprise Edition and above), and this data contributes to storage costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Fail-safe provides a non-configurable recovery window (typically 7 days) beyond the Time Travel period,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
strictly for Snowflake's use in case of system-wide failures or catastrophic events. This data is not directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
accessible to users, but is crucial for system integrity, and, importantly, users pay for its storage. Data storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
costs continue until data is completely purged from Fail-safe, as the underlying storage is still actively in use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
to provide this recovery mechanism. Options A, C, and D are incorrect. Time Travel does affect data storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
costs, but only up to the point that data expires from Time Travel, after which it's still subject to Fail-safe andits associated cost. Deleting data (C) or truncating a table (D) simply initiate data's journey through Time                                                                                                                                            
Travel and Fail-safe; they don't immediately eliminate associated storage costs. The costs are incurred till the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
time the data is no longer maintained as part of the fail-safe mechanism. Therefore, the key differentiator is

Time Travel in Snowflake allows you to access historical data at any point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
within a defined period. However, the retention period varies depending on the type of object. Temporary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
tables are designed for short-term data storage within a user session and are automatically dropped when the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
session ends. Given their ephemeral nature, Snowflake imposes a limited Time Travel retention period on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
temporary tables. The Time Travel retention period for standard and permanent tables can be up to 90 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
(for Snowflake Enterprise Edition and higher). But temporary tables only get a maximum retention period of 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
day. This reflects their use case for transient data, optimizing storage and cost associated with Time Travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
This shorter retention period ensures that temporary data doesn't unnecessarily consume storage or impactperformance. The shortened timeframe also alleviates some concerns about accidental recovery of

The correct answer is D. 0 days. Transient tables in Snowflake are specifically designed for temporary data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
that does not require long-term persistence or data recovery beyond the standard Time Travel retention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
period. Unlike permanent tables which have a default Fail-safe period of 7 days, transient tables have no Failsafe retention period. This means that once data falls outside the Time Travel window (which is configurable,                                                                                                                                                
but typically 1 day for standard editions and up to 90 days for Enterprise), it's no longer recoverable throughstandard Snowflake mechanisms. This design choice reflects the use case of transient tables for staging data                                                                                                                                                
or short-term analysis, where the need for historical recovery after time travel has expired is not considered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
critical. Fail-safe is intended to protect against extreme failures and is the final stage before data is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
permanently purged. Because of their transient nature, there's no fail-safe for this type of data, making the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
retention period 0 days after the expiry of the Time Travel window. This makes transient tables more costeffective for temporary use cases because of the reduced storage needed for fail-safe.

The correct answer is A. 1 day. Snowflake's Time Travel feature allows accessing historical data at any point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
within a defined period. The default data retention period for Time Travel, if no specific setting is configured,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
is indeed 1 day. This means you can query and restore data as it existed within the past 24 hours without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
incurring any additional costs or requiring Enterprise Edition. Data retention beyond the default 1 day is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
possible, up to a maximum of 90 days for Snowflake Enterprise Edition and higher. Standard Edition accounts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
can extend it up to 7 days using the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter. However, extending theTime Travel period beyond the default incurs additional storage costs as Snowflake maintains the necessary

This retention period can be modified at the account, database, or schema level, allowing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
organizations to tailor the period based on their specific data recovery and auditing needs. For instance,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
critical financial data might warrant a longer retention period than less sensitive data.

The correct answer, 14 days, reflects Snowflake's default data retention period for Snowpipe load history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Understanding data retention is crucial in cloud data warehousing, impacting auditing, troubleshooting, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
compliance. Snowpipe load history provides a record of files loaded through the pipe, including status, errors,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
and timestamps. While it might seem intuitive that the history persists indefinitely or until the pipe is dropped,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake imposes a retention period for performance and storage efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option A is incorrect because while you can configure Snowpipe with error notifications and other parameters,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
you cannot configure the data load history retention period. Option B is wrong, as the load history does not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
persist indefinitely even if the pipe exists. Option C is also incorrect; the retention is shorter than 64 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The 14-day retention period strikes a balance between providing sufficient time for monitoring and

After 14 days, the history is automatically

If longer retention is required, one would need to consider external logging

retention period is 1 day by default. This means you can query or restore data from up to 1 day in the past.

contrasts to the default 7 days or up to 90 days for Enterprise Edition permanent tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Fail-safe, on the other hand, provides a safety net for data recovery in the event of catastrophic system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
failures. Crucially, transient tables are not protected by Fail-safe. This means that if a transient table is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
dropped or corrupted, Snowflake does not provide a mechanism to recover it after the Time Travel window                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
has expired. Because Fail-safe is skipped, there is no cost for Fail-safe storage for transient tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
This design choice reflects the use case for transient tables: temporary storage or data staging where longterm recoverability is not a priority. Skipping Fail-safe makes them more cost-effective for these purposes.                                                                                                                                                    
The trade-off is that you are accepting a greater risk of data loss beyond the 1 day Time Travel window.

This duration is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
configurable for specific objects like tables and databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Once the Time Travel retention period expires, the historical data transitions into Fail-safe. Fail-safe is a nonconfigurable, 7-day period during which Snowflake retains the historical data. Unlike Time Travel, Fail-safe is                                                                                                                                           
not directly accessible by the user. It's a safety net for Snowflake to recover data in case of catastrophic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
system failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, when the Time Travel retention period concludes, the data doesn't simply disappear or get cloned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
It's moved into Fail-safe. Cloning the data (option A) is incorrect because that would duplicate the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
unnecessarily. Dropping the object (option D) would defeat the purpose of data protection. Dropping Time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Travel on the historical data (option C) is partially correct, as Time Travel is no longer available after the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
defined period, but it doesn't fully describe what happens to the data itself. It's still retained within Fail-safe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Fail-safe serves as the last line of defense for data recovery managed by Snowflake.

The correct answer is indeed C, 31 days. Snowflake's query result caching mechanism retains results for 24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
hours initially. However, this 24-hour timer isn't fixed; it's reset every time the cached result is reused. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
means that if the same query is executed and its result is pulled from the cache within those 24 hours, the 24hour timer restarts from that reuse point. The maximum period this retention can be extended by repeated                                                                                                                                                     
reuse is limited to 31 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This design ensures that frequently accessed query results, which likely represent crucial data or common

significantly reduces resource consumption, especially for complex or long-running queries, and contributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
to cost savings and enhanced query performance. Snowflake automatically manages this caching behavior,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and developers don’t have explicit control over the precise caching process except through specific query

The 31-day limit ensures that cache entries eventually expire, preventing stale data from

The correct answer is B: When the persisted query result period ends. Scoped URLs in Snowflake provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
access to query results, not the underlying data itself. These URLs are specifically tied to the lifespan of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
persisted query result. When a query is executed in Snowflake, the results can be cached for later access, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
the persisted result period defines how long this cache is kept. A scoped URL is a secure way to share access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
to this cached result. The URL's validity is directly linked to the persisted result's validity. Once the persisted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
query result expires according to its configured duration (which has a default duration), the scoped URL also                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
becomes invalid, preventing further access. This mechanism ensures that access to data is not permanent and

Option A is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
incorrect because the data cache is not directly related to URL expiration. Option C is incorrect as scoped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
URLs are not permanent. Option D is incorrect because the expiration_time argument doesn't control the

tracks information about data access within the platform. This view logs details about queries executed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
objects accessed, and the users involved. Snowflake retains this access history data for a specific duration,

The correct answer is A. 0 days. Fail-safe is a Snowflake feature that provides a historical record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
of data, enabling recovery in case of failures. However, it's crucial to understand that fail-safe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
only applies to permanent tables. Transient and temporary tables, designed for short-term data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
storage and processing, are intentionally excluded from fail-safe's protection. These tables are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
automatically dropped or purged after a specified duration or at the end of the session,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
respectively, hence they do not retain any historical data. Therefore, the fail-safe retention period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
for both transient and temporary tables is effectively zero days. This is by design, as these tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
are meant for ephemeral data where long-term recovery is not a requirement or cost-effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
This distinction helps optimize storage costs and performance within the Snowflake ecosystem by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
avoiding the overhead of data retention for these types of tables. The primary focus of fail-safe is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
the recovery of permanent data which has the most strategic and long-term implications.

A. All child objects will retain data for the new retention period.<br>B. All child objects that do not have an explicit retention period will automatically inherit the new retention<br>C. All child objects with an explicit retention period will be overridden with the new retention period.<br>D. All explicit child object retention periods will remain unchanged.

The correct answer is B: All child objects that do not have an explicit retention period will

Snowflake's Time Travel feature allows recovery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
of historical data, governed by a data retention period. When you change the data retention period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
at the schema level, it impacts how long deleted or modified data within that schema is preserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
However, this change doesn't force alterations to explicitly set retention periods on child objects

If a child object doesn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
have its own specified retention period, it defaults to the retention period set at the schema level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
If a child object already has a defined retention period, it remains unaffected by changes at the

This means changing the schema retention only affects child objects that are

Therefore, altering a schema's retention period provides a way to

Even though the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS

The answer is D: The object is retained for the data retention period. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake's Time Travel feature allows for querying data as it existed at a specific point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
in the past. This functionality relies on retaining dropped objects (tables, schemas,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
databases) and their associated data for a defined period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
When a table or schema is dropped, it's not immediately purged from the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Instead, it enters a "dropped" state. It's still present within Snowflake's internal

The duration for which the dropped object is retained is governed by the "data retention

During this retention period, the dropped object and its data remain accessible for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
recovery. After the retention period expires, the object transitions to Fail-safe, which is a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
secure recovery mechanism managed by Snowflake. Data in Fail-safe is not useraccessible and is only used by Snowflake to recover data in the event of a system failure

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they contradict Snowflake's Time Travel and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Fail-safe mechanisms. Dropping a table or schema does not immediately remove it (A),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
instantaneously move it to Fail-safe (B), or purge all associated data (C).

data is kept for the retention period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Therefore, retaining the dropped object for the data retention period ensures data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
recoverability through Time Travel and is the core principle behind Snowflake's dataprotection strategy.
