The correct answer is D. Table. Snowflake's Time Travel feature allows restoring historical data, and the

is not set at the account, database, or schema level. Instead, it is defined most granularly at the table level.

The correct answer is D. 24 hours. Here's why: Snowflake's Continuous Data Protection (CDP), which enables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Time Travel and Fail-safe, applies differently to various object types. Temporary tables, designed for shortlived operations within a session, have a much more restricted CDP window compared to permanent tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Specifically, Time Travel for temporary tables is limited to a maximum of 1 day (24 hours). After this period,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
the historical data is purged, and it's no longer recoverable using Time Travel functionalities.

provides recovery protection for permanent tables and schema objects within a defined Fail-safe period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
This shorter CDP window for temporary tables reflects their purpose – to hold intermediate or sessionspecific data which are usually transient in nature. The 24-hour limit ensures efficient use of storage and

The correct answer is B: The transient table version cannot be retrieved after 24 hours. Here's why:

Snowflake allows setting shorter Time Travel durations, it cannot exceed the limit imposed by the edition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Extending the Time Travel period beyond 1 day requires upgrading to a higher Snowflake edition (Enterprise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
or Business Critical). The data retention period is a crucial aspect of data governance and recovery strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A shorter retention period impacts the cost, as old data requires storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
For the Snowflake Standard Edition, the maximum Time Travel retention period is fixed at 1 day.

What are the considerations for recovering table T1?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A. The user can recover the table T1 after 30 days.<br>B. The table can be recovered because the table retention period default is at the database level.<br>C. The table can only be recovered by contacting Snowflake Support to recover the table from Fail-safe.<br>D. The table cannot be recovered because the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS was not set for table T1.

Here's a detailed justification for why option B is the correct answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake's time travel feature allows for data recovery within a specified retention period.

fact that the user did not set the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS on table T1 does not mean                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
that time travel isn't active for the table or that it's immediately non-recoverable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Therefore, option A is incorrect because while the database retention is 30 days, the table won't

Option C is incorrect as Fail-safe is
