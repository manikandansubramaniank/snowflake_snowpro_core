The statement is false. Fail-safe in Snowflake is a data recovery service that provides a 7-day period after the

The correct answer is A. Temporary and B. Transient.

tables are specifically designed for short-term data storage needs, thus they are excluded from Fail-safe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
protection. Temporary tables exist only within a session, while transient tables are available for longer but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
lack fail-safe coverage. Fail-safe ensures data is retained for 7 days after time travel, providing an additional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
safety net beyond traditional time travel. Permanent tables inherently require this extra layer of data safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, due to their ephemeral nature, temporary and transient tables do not require and cannot benefit

The statement "All Snowflake table types include fail-safe storage" is false. While Snowflake provides failsafe, a crucial component for data recovery, it's not universally applicable to all table types. Specifically,                                                                                                                                                                                                       
transient tables, a distinct table type in Snowflake, explicitly do not utilize fail-safe storage. Fail-safe is

tables, however, are purposed for temporary data usage and do not have the same durability requirements as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
standard or permanent tables. They bypass fail-safe storage and offer lower storage costs and simplified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
management trade off compared to standard table. Consequently, the recovery option is restricted to the time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
travel period for transient tables. Therefore, transient tables cannot be recovered after their time travel

This differentiation in storage resilience based on table type is central to Snowflake's data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
management flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The absence of fail-safe for transient tables demonstrates

Unlike time travel, which offers user-controlled data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
recovery within a specific timeframe, fail-safe provides an additional layer of protection beyond that, typically

The correct answer is A: There is no Fail-safe period for temporary and transient tables in Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Fail-safe is a key data protection feature in Snowflake designed to provide a recovery period after the Time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Travel retention period has expired. It allows Snowflake to recover historical data if needed, even after the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
standard Time Travel window (up to 90 days for Enterprise Edition and higher) is over. However, this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
protection comes with associated storage costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Temporary and transient tables are designed for short-term data storage and processing, prioritizing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
performance and minimizing storage overhead. They serve different purposes than permanent tables.Temporary tables exist only for the duration of a session and are automatically dropped at the end of the

Transient tables persist until explicitly dropped, but they are specifically intended for non-critical

Due to the intended ephemeral nature of both temporary and transient tables, Snowflake purposefully omits

Data stored in these table types is

Time Travel: Time Travel allows users to access historical data within a defined period.

this by retaining the data as it changes, effectively creating versions of the data at different points in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
This retention inherently requires additional storage to house these historical data versions.

D. Data encryption: Encryption scrambles data to protect confidentiality, but it does not automatically mean                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
more data is stored. Data encryption, whether at rest or in transit, primarily affects how data is stored and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
transmitted, not the total volume of data stored.https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/securityencryption.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
E. External stages: External stages (like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) are used to stage data outside of

Fail-safe is a Snowflake data protection feature designed to safeguard data against unexpected failures and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
is not directly under user control. It operates in the background after the Time Travel retention period expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Fail-safe specifically protects data within permanent objects, such as permanent tables (A) and materialized

temporary tables (B) or transient tables (E), because these object types are designed for short-term data

Fail-safe ensures data recovery in the event of system failures, typically for a period

Time Travel: This feature enables querying data at any point within a defined period (up to 90 days for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Enterprise editions and above). It's automatic, requiring no explicit user backup configurations, making it a key                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
continuous protection mechanism. By simply using a specific timestamp or offset, you can retrieve previous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
versions of your data. This functionality is akin to a versioning system built directly into the data platform,

The correct answer is A. 0 days. Fail-safe is a Snowflake feature providing a historical data recovery period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
after the time travel retention period expires. Transient tables in Snowflake, unlike permanent tables, are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
designed for long-term data retention. Consequently, they do not have a fail-safe period. This means that once                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the time travel period (which defaults to 1 day or the customized setting) expires for a transient table, the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
is no longer recoverable by Snowflake itself using its native features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The core principle here aligns with the design intention of transient tables, which are meant for temporary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
data processing and not long-term storage. Therefore, the fail-safe mechanism, which is intended to be an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
extra layer of data protection, is omitted for these tables. This design contributes to optimized storage and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
cost management for data that has a defined and short lifecycle. If extended data protection is needed,

This behavior applies uniformly across Snowflake Enterprise Edition and higher tiers. There's no differential                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Fail-safe period applicable to transient tables based on the edition. The Fail-safe period of 0 days for

The correct answer is C, 7 days. Snowflake's Fail-safe period is a crucial component of its data protection

Fail-safe is not directly

This period begins immediately after the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Time Travel retention period ends. The standard Fail-safe period is fixed at 7 days for permanent tables,

data for a configurable period (up to 90 days for Enterprise Edition), Fail-safe is strictly a system-level

The purpose is to prevent complete data loss in extremely rare situations where user actions, or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
system failures render Time Travel recovery ineffective. Users cannot directly query or restore data from fail-safe, it's managed by Snowflake. Therefore, any data retrieval from fail-safe would require contacting

Snowflake's client redirect feature is primarily designed to enhance business continuity and disaster recovery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
capabilities. It achieves this by enabling clients to automatically connect to a secondary Snowflake account                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
located in a different geographical region if the primary account becomes unavailable. This mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
ensures minimal disruption to services in case of regional outages or other catastrophic events.

leverages DNS to redirect client traffic, which is a common and reliable approach for failover and traffic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
routing in cloud environments. The redirection happens seamlessly for client applications, requiring no manual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
intervention. Data replication, while crucial for disaster recovery, is a separate process from client redirection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Client redirection focuses on maintaining application availability, while data replication focuses on keeping                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
the secondary account synchronized with the primary. The redirection feature does not aim to provide data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
replication but ensures client connections are directed to an available Snowflake account in case of failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
By directing connections to a different region, this feature ensures that application services can continue to

The correct answer is A. Fail-safe. Fail-safe in Snowflake is a non-configurable, behind-the-scenes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
disaster recovery mechanism that protects historical data. It's distinct from Time Travel, which is

This feature is managed entirely by Snowflake and cannot be configured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
or altered by the user. Unlike cloning, which creates a copy of a database, schema, or table, Fail-safe works at the system level to ensure data persistence. Account replication, meanwhile, is a                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
separate mechanism to replicate data across accounts, and is not directly tied to short-term data

Fail-safe acts as a last line of defense in data protection, automatically safeguarding

high availability. Itâ€™s crucial to understand that Fail-safe isn't intended for user-initiated data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
restoration; instead, it facilitates Snowflake's ability to recover data internally when necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Therefore, among the options, only Fail-safe fits the description of a non-configurable feature,

This ensures that even after data becomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
inaccessible through time travel, Snowflake maintains a backup for another 7 days for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
disaster recovery purposes. Transient tables, in contrast, lack a fail-safe period, meaning

The correct answer is D, Fail-safe. Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Fail-safe is the last resort data recovery mechanism in Snowflake.

Because of this limited access and the inherent complexity of invoking the failsafe period, it should only be considered when all other options have been exhausted.
