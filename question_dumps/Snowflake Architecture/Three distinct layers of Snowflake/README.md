Therefore, the correct options that reflect the benefits of Snowflake’s separated architecture are B, C, and D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
This separation optimizes resource utilization and reduces costs, which is crucial in cloud computing.

The Cloud Services Layer relies on a global service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
architecture for these functions and doesn't interact with user data directly. The separation of metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
management into this layer allows for independent scaling and high availability, while also simplifying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
resource management. Storing metadata in the Cloud Services Layer also allows for faster retrieval for query

The correct answer is True. Snowflake's architecture is fundamentally designed for the cloud, diverging from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
traditional database systems. Unlike many solutions that adapted existing technologies like Hadoop or onpremises databases to cloud environments, Snowflake was conceived and built specifically for cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This "cloud-native" approach allowed Snowflake to fully

The correct answer is C, "Migrate Indexes," because Snowflake does not utilize traditional database indexes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
in the same way as legacy data warehouses. Snowflake's architecture relies on a columnar storage formatand sophisticated query optimization techniques, which often render explicit index creation unnecessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Instead of manually created indexes, Snowflake leverages micro-partitions, which are small, immutable units

Therefore, the concept of manually migrating indexes from a traditional data warehouse is irrelevant when

The correct answer is C, Multi-cluster, shared data. Snowflake's architecture is not a traditional sharednothing or shared-disk system. Instead, it employs a unique, cloud-optimized approach. Option A, Columnar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
shared nothing, while using a columnar storage format, doesn't fully describe Snowflake's architecture as its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
compute clusters can access the same data, meaning not strictly "shared nothing". Option B, Shared disk, is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
also not accurate because Snowflake decouples storage and compute. Option D, Cloud-native shared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
memory, is incorrect because Snowflake does not rely on shared memory between compute nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Snowflake's core architecture is best characterized by its multi-cluster, shared data design. This means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
multiple independent compute clusters can operate concurrently on the same underlying data storage layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Each cluster is an independent compute unit that can scale up or down as needed.

Similarly, while caching is a crucial aspect of Snowflakeperformance, the virtual warehouse layer is responsible for managing the local cache for query results; the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Cloud Services layer is involved in the metadata and result cache management but not the direct data cache

Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake's architecture fundamentally separates compute and storage. Storage is handled by a centralized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
data repository, and compute is handled by virtual warehouses. Each virtual warehouse is an independent,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
elastic compute cluster that doesn't share resources with other warehouses. This separation allows multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
users and workloads to operate concurrently without competing for resources. If a virtual warehouse is busy,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
you can simply spin up another one. This avoids resource contention and ensures consistent performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Options A, B, D, and E are either incorrect or less directly represent a key architectural feature aimed at                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
resource contention. While zero-copy cloning (A) is valuable, it's not primarily designed to eliminate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
contention. Option B is about update schedules which does not adress resource contention. Option D, multicluster warehouses, can help alleviate contention by distributing workload, but the core principle of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
eliminating contention comes from the isolation of each virtual warehouse. Lastly, Option E is simply incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Snowflake does not automatically sort DATE columns during ingestion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
In contrast, the separation of compute and storage and the independent operation of virtual warehouses are

The correct answer is C. Cloud services. Snowflake's architecture is divided into three main layers: Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Storage, Compute, and Cloud Services. The Cloud Services layer is the "brain" of the system, responsible for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
managing and coordinating activities across the other two layers. A crucial part of this coordination is query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
processing. When a user submits a query, it's the Cloud Services layer that receives and parses the SQL,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
optimizes the execution strategy, and generates the execution plan. This plan dictates the steps the compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
layer will take to retrieve and process data. It also handles metadata management, security, and access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
control. The Compute layer, while executing the plan, does not create it.

Virtual Warehouses provide the compute power needed to execute queries, load data, and perform other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
operations. They scale independently of the storage and cloud services layers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Data storage (D) is managed by the Snowflake Storage layer. This layer handles the physical storage of data

The Snowflake architecture is divided into three layers: the Cloud Services layer, the Query Processing layer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
(Compute), and the Database Storage layer. The Cloud Services layer acts as the brain of the system,

B. Snowflake data and services are available in a single cloud provider and a single region; the use of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
multiple cloud providers is not supported. This is also incorrect.

C. Snowflake can be deployed in a customer’s private cloud using the customer’s own compute and storage

Snowflake's architecture comprises three distinct layers: the Cloud Services layer, the Compute layer, and the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Storage layer. Each handles specific tasks to deliver a fully managed data warehouse service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The Cloud Services layer acts as the "brain" of Snowflake. It manages activities across the entire system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Authentication and Access Control (E): This is a crucial aspect of security handled by the Cloud Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
layer. It validates user identities, manages user permissions, and enforces access control policies to protectdata. This aligns with cloud security best practices where identity and access management are central.

This allows you to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
increase compute power during peak usage periods (e.g., during large ETL jobs) and then reduce it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
demand is lower, optimizing cost. The ability to resize warehouses on-the-fly without data movement makes

Option A is incorrect as it is the opposite of Snowflake's architecture. Growth of storage and compute are not

Option D is incorrect because while compute and storage can be scaled together, it's not a requirement.

primary benefit lies in their independent scalability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option E, while related to storage efficiency, isn't the most direct benefit of separating compute and storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Disk spilling happens when insufficient compute resources are available, so separate scaling of compute is

The correct answer is C: It is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing database architectures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Snowflake's architecture distinctly separates storage and compute resources, a key characteristic of a hybrid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
approach. Unlike a shared-disk architecture where all compute nodes access the same storage directly,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake utilizes a central storage layer (shared-disk in principle). However, this storage is not directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
accessed by compute nodes; instead, it is accessed through a virtual layer. The compute nodes, organized into                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
virtual warehouses, operate independently from each other, representing a shared-nothing architecture.

warehouse has its own independent compute resources (memory, CPU). This separation allows for

The correct answer is B, Database Storage. Snowflake’s architecture is fundamentally built around three

Snowflake's “magic” happens regarding data organization. When data is ingested, it's initially in its raw form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
However, it's not stored in that form. Instead, the Database Storage layer takes on the responsibility of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
converting this incoming data into Snowflake's highly optimized, compressed, and columnar format. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
format is essential for efficient querying. Columnar storage allows Snowflake to read only the columns

The process also                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
involves micro-partitioning the data for parallel processing. Additionally, this layer handles data compression                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
to further reduce storage footprint. The Database Storage layer is designed to be independent of compute
