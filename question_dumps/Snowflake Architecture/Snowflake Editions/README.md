The correct answer is C. Enterprise. Snowflake's multi-cluster warehouses and extended Time Travel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
capabilities are not universally available across all editions. Multi-cluster warehouses, which allow for scalingcompute resources independently of storage, are a crucial feature for managing concurrent workloads and                                                                                                                                             
ensuring high availability. These are not offered in the Standard edition, which primarily focuses on singlecluster operations. While higher editions like Premier or Business Critical may seem like contenders, the key                                                                                                                                            
to the answer lies in the 90-day Time Travel requirement. Standard edition Time Travel is limited to one day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Enterprise Edition expands this to a maximum of 90 days, providing crucial data recovery flexibility. Business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Critical edition extends Time Travel up to 90 days (and optionally longer, for an added price) and adds other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
high-end security and data protection options. However, Business Critical is an overkill when we consider the

The correct answer is indeed C, Enterprise Edition.

This capability is crucial for data recovery, auditing, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
understanding data evolution. Different Snowflake editions provide varying default retention periods for Time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Travel. Standard Edition offers a retention period of only 1 day by default. While it is configurable up to 7 days,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
it does not extend beyond that. Premier Edition also has a default of 1 day, configurable to 7. In contrast,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Enterprise Edition and Business Critical Edition both extend the default retention period to 90 days, though                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Business Critical Edition offers extended retention via Fail-safe that is beyond the scope of this question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Thus, Enterprise Edition is the lowest Snowflake edition that meets the criteria of offering Time Travel up to

The correct answer is D. Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS). Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake's metadata store, which houses information about data structure, data types, user permissions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
and query history, is a critical component for its operation. While all Snowflake editions utilize a metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
store, only the Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS) edition provides a dedicated, isolated metadata store. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
isolation enhances security and performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The Standard, Enterprise, and Business Critical editions share the metadata store infrastructure with other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake accounts within the same region. Sharing can lead to resource contention, potential security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
concerns (though Snowflake implements robust isolation mechanisms), and limitations on customization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
VPS, however, offers a completely isolated environment, including a dedicated metadata store, compute

This ensures the highest level of security, control, and predictable performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Organizations with stringent regulatory compliance requirements, such as those in the government or

The correct answer is Enterprise edition. Dynamic Data Masking in Snowflake is a security feature that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
automatically masks sensitive data at query runtime, depending on the user's role and defined masking

This helps organizations comply with data privacy regulations and protect sensitive information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
without altering the underlying data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake's feature availability is tier-based. Standard edition primarily focuses on basic data warehousing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
capabilities. Enterprise edition expands upon the Standard edition by including advanced features like

compliance. Virtual Private Snowflake (VPC) is not an edition but rather an environment deployment option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
offered at the Business Critical edition level for stricter isolation and security requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Since Dynamic Data Masking is an advanced security feature, it's not included in the basic Standard edition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The Enterprise edition is the lowest tier where this functionality becomes available. The Business Critical                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
edition certainly supports it as well, due to it building on Enterprise functionality, but the question asks for the

Therefore, Enterprise is the minimum edition needed to utilize Dynamic Data

The correct answer is B and D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Snowflake's automatic encryption of all data (option B) is a fundamental security feature present across all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
editions. This includes data at rest and in transit, securing data by default. It aligns with the common securitypractices in cloud data platforms and removes the burden of enabling basic encryption from the user.                                                                                                                                                
Object-level access control (option D) is another core security capability available in all Snowflake editions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
This allows administrators to control user access to database objects such as tables, views, and schemas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Implementing access controls is a critical aspect of data governance and ensuring that only authorized                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
individuals can interact with sensitive information. This ensures that the principle of least privilege is followed,

Periodic rekeying of micro-partitions is a security feature in

The correct answer is A, Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS).

designed for organizations with strict security and compliance requirements. Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
sharing in VPS is restricted and requires Snowflake Support's direct involvement,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
deviating from the self-service sharing model available in other editions. This constraint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
stems from the isolation and enhanced control measures inherent in VPS, such as singletenant environments. In contrast, Business Critical, Enterprise, and Standard editions                                                                                                                                                                                         
allow for self-service data sharing using Snowflake's secure share mechanism. Business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Critical offers advanced features like failover/failback, but still provides direct data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
sharing capabilities. Enterprise and Standard editions offer data sharing as a core

VPS, focusing on maximum data isolation and controlled access, leads to this limitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
It prioritizes security and compliance over ease of sharing, making direct user-managed

of selecting a specific Snowflake edition, while options B, D, and E are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake offers different editions (Standard, Premium, Enterprise, etc.) which primarily                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
influence the features available and the cost structure. The core components like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
compute and storage remain consistent across editions, but their pricing models and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
some usage limits differ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option A is correct because different Snowflake editions have varying unit costs for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
storage. Premium editions often have lower storage costs per terabyte compared to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Standard editions, reflecting economies of scale and commitment levels. While all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
editions utilize the same storage infrastructure, the price per unit differs significantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option C is also correct as the unit costs for compute credits vary significantly across

Higher tier editions often have reduced compute credit costs for the same

Option D is incorrect because Snowflake does not have a fixed limit on storage space

There is not a "cap" on total storage available.Option E is incorrect because Snowflake does not place a hard limit on the number of                                                                                                                                                                                              
compute credits that can be consumed. Instead, compute consumption is billed based on

While there might be some pre-purchase commitments, no specific edition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
imposes an inherent consumption limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
In summary, Snowflake editions primarily impact the unit costs for storage and compute,
