The correct answer is C, USE WAREHOUSE <<warehouse name>>;. In Snowflake, virtual warehouses are the

To execute queries using a specific warehouse, you must explicitly set it

Moving                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
up to the next size, a Medium warehouse, involves doubling the resources of the preceding size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Consequently, a Medium warehouse will have twice the number of servers as a Small warehouse. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
since a Small warehouse has 2 servers, a Medium warehouse will have 2 * 2 = 4 servers or 2 clusters (1 cluster== 2 servers). This principle of scaling by doubling continues for larger warehouse sizes as well. This allows

Multi-cluster warehouses in Snowflake are designed to handle concurrent user requests and varying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
workloads efficiently. Auto-scale mode, specifically, enables a warehouse to dynamically adjust its cluster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
count based on demand. When the minimum and maximum cluster settings are set to different values,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake can automatically scale the warehouse up to the specified maximum to accommodate increased

Setting these to the same value essentially                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
disables scaling, as the warehouse will always maintain that fixed number of clusters. Option A is incorrect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
because there is no "Auto-Scale" setting for Maximum Clusters itself. Option B is incorrect because "Auto" is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
not a valid warehouse type in Snowflake. Option C would prevent the auto-scaling functionality, rendering the

particular database the warehouse might be querying, or specific queries themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Auto-suspend is crucial for managing costs as it prevents unnecessary compute charges when the warehouse

The provided answer (A, C) is only partially correct; the most accurate and complete answer is A and B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Let's dissect why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
A. The complexity of each query: This is correct. More complex queries, involving joins, aggregations, andintricate calculations, consume more resources (CPU, memory, I/O) and therefore reduce the number of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
queries a warehouse can concurrently process before performance degrades.

small table will allow for higher concurrency than a complex query joining multiple large tables.

intensity directly impacts warehouse capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
B. The CONCURRENT_QUERY_LIMIT parameter set on the Snowflake account: This parameter, specifically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
on the warehouse, is crucial and dictates an explicit limit on concurrent queries. It's a system-imposed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
constraint regardless of query complexity. If this limit is reached, new queries will be queued.

While scaling out can indirectly impact performance, the primary benefit is the improved concurrency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Performance gains are often observed through reduced queuing times and faster response times due to the

isn't necessarily improved by the addition of more clusters, as that is generally determined by the size (XSmall, Small, etc.) and not the number of clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The purpose is to ensure that if many users submit queries at once, there are enough compute resources to

Snowflake focuses on improving a single query performance. You'd scale out, adding more independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
clusters of a specific size, for greater concurrency. So, while increased capacity might handle more queries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
within a given time window, the core focus of a size increase is to boost the individual query processing

In essence, vertical scaling (increasing the warehouse size) is about getting faster execution,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
whereas horizontal scaling (adding clusters) deals more directly with concurrency.

serverless architecture is a core aspect of Snowflake’s design, allowing for efficient and scalable data loading                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
without the need for continuously running infrastructure. The Pipe's metadata is managed and stored by

The correct answer is Auto-suspend and Auto-resume because these are core configuration options when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
defining how a Snowflake Virtual Warehouse operates regarding compute resource management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Auto-suspend defines the period of inactivity (in seconds) after which the warehouse automatically suspends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This feature is crucial for cost optimization, as it ensures that compute resources are only consumed when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
actively processing queries. Without auto-suspend, the warehouse would continue to run and accrue charges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
even when idle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Auto-resume determines whether the warehouse automatically resumes when a query is submitted. Enabling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
auto-resume provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to submit queries without manually starting

The statement is True. A Snowflake Virtual Warehouse can indeed be resized while it is in a suspended state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This capability is a core feature of Snowflake's architecture, offering flexibility and cost management

Scaling Out (Option A): Scaling out, also called horizontal scaling, addresses concurrency. It adds more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
compute nodes (clusters of the same size in Snowflake's terminology) to the virtual warehouse. This allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
the warehouse to process more queries concurrently. Think of it as adding more servers of the same capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
By having more nodes processing queries, Snowflake can handle a higher number of concurrent user requests                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
without performance degradation. This approach is crucial for scenarios with a large number of users or batch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
processing jobs running simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Options B, C, D, and F are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option B is incorrect: Scaling out in Snowflake involves adding clusters of the same size, not varying sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
This ensures consistent performance and simplifies management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option C is incorrect: Snowflake doesn't add additional database servers to an existing cluster for handlingconcurrency. It adds new clusters.

A. Auto-resume applies only to the last warehouse that was started in a multi-cluster warehouse.<br>B. The ability to auto-suspend a warehouse is only available in the Enterprise edition or above.<br>C. SnowSQL supports both a configuration file and a command line option for specifying a default warehouse.<br>D. A user cannot specify a default warehouse when using the ODBC driver.<br>E. The default virtual warehouse size can be changed at any time.

A. Auto-resume applies only to the last warehouse that was started in a multi-cluster warehouse.

incorrect. Auto-resume applies to the entire warehouse, regardless of whether it's a single-cluster or multicluster warehouse. Any query submitted to the warehouse will trigger auto-resume if the warehouse is

The correct answer is B and D. Let's break down why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
B. The use of warehouse auto scaling: Auto-scaling is a core feature specifically designed to handle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
concurrency. Snowflake's auto-scaling dynamically adjusts the number of active clusters in a multi-cluster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
warehouse based on the workload. As demand increases (more concurrent queries), Snowflake automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
spins up additional clusters to distribute the load, preventing queuing and maintaining performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Conversely, as demand decreases, clusters are automatically suspended to optimize cost. This dynamic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
adjustment ensures the system can handle fluctuating levels of concurrency efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
D. Use of multi-clustered warehouses: Multi-cluster warehouses are designed to improve concurrency and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
availability. By having multiple independent compute clusters sharing access to the same data, Snowflake can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
distribute the workload across these clusters. When a query is submitted, Snowflake intelligently routes it to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
an available cluster. This prevents a single cluster from becoming overloaded when many queries are

This parallel processing significantly boosts the system's ability to handle high                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
concurrency without performance degradation. Each cluster functions as an independent compute resource,

Why other options are not the best fit:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
A. The ability to scale up warehouses: Scaling up a warehouse (increasing its size) increases the compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
power of a single cluster. While this can improve the performance of individual queries, it doesn't directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
address concurrency issues. A larger warehouse will still face queuing problems if multiple users are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
submitting queries at the same time and could be less cost effective than scaling out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
C. The ability to resize warehouses: Resizing a warehouse, like scaling up, primarily focuses on increasing the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
resources available to a single cluster. While this can benefit performance, it doesn't inherently address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
concurrency, the ability to handle many concurrent queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
E. The use of warehouse indexing: Snowflake does not expose indexing to the user. Snowflake uses its

The correct answer is D. When a large number of concurrent queries are run on the same warehouse. Here's

Multi-cluster warehouses in Snowflake, especially when configured for auto-scaling, are designed to handle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
fluctuating workloads and high concurrency. When many users or applications submit queries simultaneously,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
a single warehouse might become overloaded, leading to queuing and performance degradation. Auto-scaling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
addresses this by dynamically adding more compute clusters to the warehouse as demand increases. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
allows Snowflake to parallelize query execution across these clusters, ensuring that queries are processed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
efficiently without bottlenecks. The goal is to maintain consistent performance, even when handling a high                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
volume of concurrent requests. The other options do not directly correlate with the primary use case of multicluster warehouses. While 'A' addresses uncertainty about compute needs, it doesn't specifically necessitate

A. Use multi-clustered warehousing to scale out warehouse capacity.<br>B. Scale up the warehouse size to allow queries to execute faster.<br>C. Stop and start the warehouse to clear the queued queries.<br>D. Migrate some queries to a new warehouse to reduce load.<br>E. Limit user access to the warehouse so fewer queries are run against it.

The goal is to increase processing capacity or distribute the load more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
A. Use multi-clustered warehousing to scale out warehouse capacity: Multi-clustering allows a warehouse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
to automatically scale out by adding more compute resources (clusters) when the load increases. This is ideal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
for handling concurrent query loads because it provides parallel processing capabilities. Each cluster can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
handle a subset of the queries, significantly reducing queuing and improving overall performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Snowflake's auto-scale feature handles this automatically. Snowflake Multi-Cluster Warehouses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
D. Migrate some queries to a new warehouse to reduce load: This involves splitting the workload across                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
multiple warehouses. By routing some queries to a separate warehouse, the load on the original warehouse is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
reduced, thereby decreasing the number of queries queuing. This strategy is especially effective if different                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
query workloads have different resource requirements (e.g., one set is CPU-intensive, and another is I/Ointensive). This approach promotes resource isolation. For instance, extract/load/transform (ELT) processes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
could run on one warehouse while reporting and dashboarding queries run on another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Why other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
B. Scale up the warehouse size to allow queries to execute faster: While scaling up can help individual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
queries execute faster, it primarily addresses slow query execution time rather than query queuing.

up alone might not be sufficient if the number of concurrent queries is the root cause of the queuing problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
It's also generally more cost-effective to scale out rather than scale up, as you only pay for the additional

C. Stop and start the warehouse to clear the queued queries: This is a short-sighted solution.

temporarily alleviate the issue by clearing the queue, the problem will quickly resurface if the warehouse is

It doesn't address the underlying capacity constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
E. Limit user access to the warehouse so fewer queries are run against it: This is an undesirable and often

cluster in an auto-scaling multi-cluster warehouse operating under the ECONOMY scaling policy only after                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
sustained load persists for a specific duration. This delay helps avoid unnecessary cluster spin-ups due to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
transient spikes in workload. The wait time is designed to ensure the additional cluster is genuinely required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and not just a temporary fluctuation. The documentation (https://docs.snowflake.com/en/userguide/warehouses-multicluster.html#scaling-policy) specifies that with the ECONOMY scaling policy, a new                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
cluster starts when there's enough load for 6 minutes. This contrasts with the STANDARD policy, which starts

Snowflake's architecture separates compute (virtual warehouses)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
from storage. Virtual warehouses are essentially clusters of compute resources that perform the data

A key responsibility of these warehouses is to execute queries submitted by users or applications. When a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
user runs a SQL query, Snowflake's query optimizer determines the most efficient execution plan. This plan is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
then handed off to a virtual warehouse to perform the actual computation, including retrieving data from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
storage, performing aggregations, applying filters, and ultimately generating the query result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option A, Infrastructure management, is incorrect because Snowflake manages the underlying infrastructure,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
abstracting it away from the user. The user simply specifies the size of the warehouse they need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option B, Metadata management, is also incorrect. Snowflake's metadata management is handled separately,

The correct answer is C. To eliminate or reduce queuing of concurrent queries. Multi-cluster virtual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
warehouses in Snowflake are designed to handle a high volume of concurrent queries without experiencing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
significant queuing or performance degradation. They achieve this by creating multiple independent clusters,all of which share access to the same underlying data storage. When a new query arrives, Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
intelligently routes it to a cluster with available capacity, effectively distributing the workload.

The system doesn't react to a single underutilization event, but rather to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
consistent lack of load, typically over multiple consecutive checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
The duration, usually 2-3 checks, isn't an exact science and depends on the specific configuration and system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
conditions, however, this duration ensures that the system is indeed underutilized and not just experiencing a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
temporary lull. This avoids unnecessary cluster oscillations. The system monitors the least-loaded cluster and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
checks the redistribution potential. If these conditions persist, the system initiates the shutdown process on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
the least-loaded cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, option D, "When after 2-3 consecutive checks the system determines that the load on the leastloaded cluster could be redistributed," accurately reflects this process, and it is the right answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they either focus on the most-loaded cluster, which isn't the

D is partially correct, as virtual warehouses participate in query optimization.

This parameter is about the overall execution time, not the wait time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
specifically. Option C, MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL, dictates the maximum number of queries that can run                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
concurrently on the warehouse. While it affects contention indirectly, it doesn't define how long a query willwait. Option D, QUERY_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, is another way to define overall query timeout, similar to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS but applied at a different level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Essentially, during periods of high warehouse utilization, STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the key safeguard against lengthy wait times, ensuring queries don’t become perpetually stuck in the queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Understanding the difference between these timeout parameters is crucial for efficient Snowflake resource

The correct answer is D. Increase the warehouse MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Here's why: The problem description clearly indicates a resource contention issue: queries are running slowly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
and being queued. This signifies that the current virtual warehouse is unable to handle the concurrent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
workload demands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:A. Reduce the warehouse STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN SECONDS parameter: This parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
determines how long a query waits in the queue before timing out. Reducing this doesn't solve the underlying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
resource constraint; it merely shortens the wait time before failure, potentially leading to more user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
frustration. It doesn't address the queuing issue itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
B. Reduce the warehouse AUTO_SUSPEND parameter: The AUTO_SUSPEND parameter dictates the

The correct answer is A. When the size of a Snowflake virtual warehouse is changed (scaled up or down),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
currently running queries are not impacted. This is a key aspect of Snowflake's architecture and is designed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
to provide minimal disruption to ongoing workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Snowflake achieves this by ensuring that the compute resources used by existing queries remain isolated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within the original warehouse configuration. The scaling operation creates a new warehouse with the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
requested size. New queries will then be routed to this newly sized warehouse, while existing queries continue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
to execute on the initial configuration until they complete. This approach ensures transactional consistency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and prevents unexpected query failures or data corruption. The user does not need to resubmit queries

resources used by queries do not magically "move" from the original warehouse to the newly sized one (ruling

The correct answer is C. Create separate warehouses for each workload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Here's why: In Snowflake, virtual warehouses are the compute resources used to execute queries and data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
loading operations. When multiple users share a single warehouse (WH_DEV_01 in this scenario), their                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
workloads compete for the same compute resources. This leads to contention, where loading data consumes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
resources needed for querying, resulting in performance issues for the user querying the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option A, scaling up the existing warehouse, might temporarily alleviate the issue by providing more compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
power. However, it doesn't address the underlying problem of resource contention between different                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
workloads. Both users still share the same, albeit larger, resources and will continue to impact each other's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
performance.Option B, creating separate warehouses for each user, could improve performance, but it is not as precise as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
option C, because it does not necessarily reflect the workload. For instance, a user may be executing two                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
completely separate workloads, that should not contend on the same compute resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option D, stopping loading and querying simultaneously, is not a practical solution. It restricts the use of the

Creating separate warehouses for each workload (C) offers the best approach. By dedicating specific                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
warehouses for loading and querying, each workload operates within its dedicated resources.

user will not consume the processing power of the querying user and vice versa. This isolates performance

Additionally, this allows for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
granular cost management and scaling based on the specific needs of each workload, leading to a more costeffective use of Snowflake's resources.

The correct answer is C. To improve concurrency for users and queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Multi-clustering in Snowflake virtual warehouses is primarily designed to enhance concurrency. A single                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
virtual warehouse might struggle to handle a large number of concurrent queries or user requests, leading to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
queuing and performance degradation. Multi-clustering addresses this by automatically scaling the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
warehouse horizontally, adding more compute resources (additional clusters) when needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
When the number of concurrent queries exceeds the capacity of a single cluster within the warehouse,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake dynamically spins up additional clusters.

The cost of running a multi-cluster virtual warehouse in Snowflake is primarily determined by the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
computational resources consumed over time. Specifically, two key factors contribute to the credit usage: the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
warehouse size and the number of clusters. A larger warehouse size (e.g., X-Small, Large, X-Large) translatesto more compute power, resulting in higher credit consumption per second of usage. The more clusters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
running concurrently within a multi-cluster setup, the more resources are being utilized in parallel, leading to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
an increase in credits consumed for that given period. Conversely, the cache size, volume of data processed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and number of queries executed do not directly contribute to credit calculation for virtual warehouse usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Cache primarily aids in performance enhancement by storing frequently accessed data, while data volume                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
and query count are aspects that affect query execution time and not the underlying compute cost itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Therefore, Snowflake charges for the actual compute resources consumed (warehouse size and cluster

The correct answer is C. Use a multi-cluster warehouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Here's why: Snowflake's architecture allows for scaling compute resources independently of storage. When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
supporting a large number of concurrent users (over 100 in this case), a single virtual warehouse, even a large                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
one, can become a bottleneck. While increasing the warehouse size (option D) might offer some improvement,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
it doesn't address the concurrency issue directly. Autoscaling (option B) adjusts the size of a single cluster,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
not the number of clusters, and setting it to 100 is not a valid configuration option. Adding multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
independent warehouses (option A) doesn’t allow for shared resources or easy management across the user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
base. Multi-cluster warehouses, on the other hand, are specifically designed for handling high concurrency.

Option A is incorrect because while increasing warehouse size often boosts data loading performance, it's not

The correct answer is D. Start a separate warehouse and move queued queries there. When queueing occurs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
in a Snowflake virtual warehouse, it signifies that the current warehouse lacks sufficient resources to handle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
the incoming query load promptly. Option A, decreasing the warehouse size, would exacerbate the problem by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
further limiting available compute capacity. Similarly, decreasing the MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT (option B)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
would reduce the minimum number of active clusters, making the problem worse in multi-cluster scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Option C, changing multi-cluster settings to add additional clusters, could be a valid solution for an existing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
warehouse if configured for multi-cluster mode and set to "auto-scale". However, if the warehouse is already                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
maxed out, or not in multi-cluster mode, this won't resolve the issue immediately. The most effective                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
immediate solution (option D) is to start a new warehouse and direct queued queries to it. This provides instant

This is well suited to handling many concurrent queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Vertical scaling (increasing warehouse size) increases the processing power of existing computenodes (a single cluster). This can help with faster query execution but does not increase the

The correct answer is D: It will automatically start and stop additional clusters as needed. Multicluster virtual warehouses in Snowflake offer enhanced concurrency and workload management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Unlike single-cluster warehouses, which can become overloaded with high demand, multi-cluster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
warehouses dynamically adjust their resources based on current workloads.

The correct answer is A. When queuing is delaying query execution on the warehouse. Multicluster virtual warehouses in Snowflake are designed to handle concurrency and workload

The correct answer is C: The queries will be placed in a queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Here's why: When a Snowflake virtual warehouse is fully utilized and lacks the resources                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
to immediately execute incoming queries, Snowflake doesn't simply discard or redirect

This mechanism ensures that queries

Option A is incorrect because Snowflake doesn't automatically assign queries to a

Option B is also incorrect as Snowflake prioritizes executing queries rather than skipping

Skipping would lead to data loss and incomplete operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option D is partially correct; Snowflake can automatically resize if configured to autoscale. However, this takes time. During the resizing process, queries will still be queued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Crucially, the question doesn't state that auto-scaling is enabled.

warehouse cannot resize. Since auto-scaling is not explicitly stated in the question, we

The queuing behavior allows Snowflake to maintain data integrity and avoid data loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake's architecture is designed to handle bursts of activity and ensure all queries

A. Snowflake will automatically increase the size of the virtual warehouse used to run queries against the<br>B. The number of clusters in the active virtual warehouse being used will scale automatically to accommodate<br>C. As the stored data volume increases, the warehouse performance will decline.<br>D. The warehouse performance and size will not be affected when the volume of stored data increases.
