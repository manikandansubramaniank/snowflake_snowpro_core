Which command should be used to download files from a Snowflake stage to a local folder on a client's machine?

The correct command for downloading files from a Snowflake stage to a local folder is B. GET.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The GET command in Snowflake is explicitly designed for retrieving data from a specified stage (internal or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
external) and transferring it to a local file system on the client machine where the Snowflake client is running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
It essentially reverses the process of the PUT command, which uploads files to a stage. It’s part of

Options A, C, and D are not appropriate for downloading files from a stage. PUT is for uploading data to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
stage. COPY is used for moving data within Snowflake, between tables or stages, but not for retrieving to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
local machine. SELECT retrieves data from Snowflake tables and views, but not directly from stages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Therefore, the GET command fulfills the requirement of downloading staged files, making it the correct and

It streamlines the process of transferring data out of Snowflake's storage system.

While the Snowflake web interface, including both the classic UI and Snowsight, offers a way to upload files,

web UI provides a more visual, interactive way to upload smaller files, but it is not optimized for large-scale,

different feature, likely referring to User-Defined Functions (UDFs) or external functions that allow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
processing data within Snowflake without data movement, not the purpose of SnowSQL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Therefore, SnowSQL's primary purpose is to provide a command-line interface for interacting with Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
It is not a visualization tool, a SQL dialect, or a data processing library itself.

parameters like account identifier, username, password, and database information. This avoids the need to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
input these credentials manually each time a SnowSQL session is initiated, enhancing efficiency and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
simplifying the connection process. While "snowsql.cnf" might seem like a logical choice, it isn't the standard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
configuration file name used by SnowSQL. The history file stores past SnowSQL commands, not connection

Utilizing a configuration file is a common practice in many command-line interfaces and software applications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
for managing settings. The config file's structure enables defining multiple connections, each with distinct

The correct options are C. output_file and D. output_format. When unloading data using SnowSQL,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
you are essentially extracting results from a Snowflake query and saving them to a local file. To                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
achieve this, SnowSQL needs to know where to save the data (specified by output_file) and in what                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
format (specified by output_format). Option C sets the path and filename for the exported data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
acting as the destination for the query results. Option D dictates how the exported data is

A. The file will continue to load until all contents are loaded.<br>B. The file will stop loading and all data up to that point will be committed.<br>C. The file loading could be aborted without any portion of the file being committed.<br>D. The file’s number of allowable hours to load can be programmatically controlled to load easily into

The correct answer is C. Snowflake imposes a 24-hour time limit on data loading operations. If a

The correct command-line flags for logging into Snowflake using SnowSQL are -a and -d.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The -a flag is crucial as it specifies the Snowflake account identifier, uniquely identifying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
the Snowflake instance you intend to connect to. This is a fundamental requirement for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
establishing a connection because Snowflake operates as a multi-tenant service, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
each account has a distinct location and configuration. Without specifying the account,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
SnowSQL cannot determine where to direct the connection request. The -d flag, on the

Without a database specified, users would have to manually switch
