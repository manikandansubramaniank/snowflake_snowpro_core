The correct answer is A: "Snowflake tables are logical representations of underlying physical data." This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
accurately describes how Snowflake manages data. Unlike traditional databases, Snowflake decouples the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
logical structure (tables) from the physical storage. When you create a table in Snowflake, you're defining its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
schema (columns, data types), which acts as a logical blueprint. The actual data is stored in Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
optimized, columnar format in cloud storage, which is abstracted from the user. This separation allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake to independently scale compute resources and storage, providing flexibility and efficiency. Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
B is incorrect because tables are not the physical instantiation, but rather a logical representation of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Snowflake automatically handles data storage and doesn't expose the physical details to the user. Option C is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
incorrect because clustering keys are optional and improve performance only in certain scenarios; tables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
function perfectly well without them. Finally, Option D is incorrect because tables are owned by a role, not a

This architecture contrasts with databases where the table definition often directly correlates to a specific

This section enables users to manage virtual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
warehouses, including their size, scaling policies, and overall costs associated with compute. It is analogous to

Worksheets (D): Worksheets are the primary space for users to interact with Snowflake using SQL. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
section is where users write, execute, and save SQL queries against their data. This is analogous to interactive

Okay, let's analyze why options B and C are the correct choices regarding Snowflake schemas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option B is correct: A Database may contain one or more Schemas. In Snowflake's hierarchical structure, a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
database serves as a container for schemas. This is a fundamental concept in database management, where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
databases organize data and objects, and schemas provide a further level of logical grouping within that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
database. You can have multiple schemas within a single database, each acting as a namespace to manage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
different sets of objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option C is also correct: A Schema is a logical grouping of Database Objects. Schemas are designed to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
organize database objects such as tables, views, stages, sequences, functions, and procedures. By using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
schemas, you can manage permissions, and keep related objects together, which makes database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
organization more efficient and helps to control access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Option A is incorrect: A Schema may not contain one or more Databases. The relationship is the opposite - adatabase contains schemas, not the other way around. Databases are higher-level organizational structures in

Option D is incorrect: Schemas are not contained within a Warehouse. Warehouses are compute resources                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
that Snowflake uses to execute queries and perform other operations on the data within the databases and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
schemas. Schemas are part of the data storage layer. Warehouses access data in databases and schemas but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
don't contain them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, the core concept here is the hierarchical organization of Snowflake, where a database is a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
container for schemas, and schemas group together different database objects. Schemas provide a way to

The statement is False. While it's common for the creating user to be granted ownership of a newly created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
object in many systems, Snowflake's object ownership model is more nuanced. By default, when a user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
creates a Snowflake object, the object is actually owned by the role that was active during the object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
creation, not the user. This distinction is crucial because a user can have multiple roles, and the active role at                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the time determines ownership. Therefore, if the user's active role does not have appropriate ownership

The correct data type for storing geospatial data in Snowflake is Geography.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Snowflake specifically provides the Geography data type for representing and storing geodetic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
(latitude/longitude-based) spatial data. This data type allows for calculations that take into account the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
curvature of the Earth, leading to accurate spatial analysis. The Geography data type conforms to the WellKnown Text (WKT) and Well-Known Binary (WKB) standards for representing spatial data, ensuring                                                                                                                                                                            
interoperability with other systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
While Geometry might seem like a relevant choice, it is designed for planar spatial data, where the Earth's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
curvature is not considered. Therefore, Geometry is more suitable for local coordinate systems or smaller                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
areas where the curvature effect is negligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Variant and Object are semi-structured data types in Snowflake. While they can store various data formats,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
including representations of spatial data, they don't offer the built-in spatial functions and optimizations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
provided by the Geography data type. Using Variant or Object for geospatial data would require manual parsing

The correct answer is C. Recreate the view with the required changes. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Views in Snowflake are essentially stored queries, not physical tables holding data. They derive their results                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
from underlying base tables. Changing the columns referenced by a view requires modifying the SQL query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
that defines the view. While you might think ALTER VIEW would work, it does not directly allow you to change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
the column list within the select statement. ALTER VIEW can modify properties like the view's name, security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
settings, or comments, but it can't change the core query itself. Option A, modifying the underlying table, is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
irrelevant as the view references the columns, not data, in that table. Modifying a table would not change how                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
the view selects the data and thus the underlying columns that it is reading. Option D, materializing the view,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
would create a new table, which doesn't modify the existing view’s column selection. Therefore, to change the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
view's referenced columns, the correct approach is to drop the existing view and then create a new view with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
the updated query, specifying the desired columns. This rebuilds the view with the modified SELECT

When the view is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
refreshed or queried, Snowflake's compute resources are used, leading to compute charges. Hence, both                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
storage and compute costs are associated with materialized views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Clustered tables (E), though not directly holding data like materialized views, are structured to optimize query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
performance based on clustering keys. When data is loaded into a clustered table, data re-organization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
happens and also when it is queried, leveraging compute. The underlying storage of the table itself incurs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
storage charges. Therefore, clustered tables involve both storage and compute costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Sequences (B) are used to generate unique numerical identifiers. They primarily use minimal storage and incur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
negligible compute costs during sequence creation and retrieval. Secure views (C) are essentially database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
views with access restrictions, not having a separate underlying data. Their storage is negligible. Querying                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
these views only involves compute. Transient tables (D) are similar to standard tables but do not have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Snowflake's time travel feature. They only incur storage cost and query compute cost, therefore not fitting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
the requirement of storage and compute charges for the object itself.Therefore, only Materialized Views and Clustered tables have storage costs and the corresponding operations

The correct answer is A: "A logical grouping of objects that belongs to a single database." Here's a detailed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
In Snowflake, a schema serves as a namespace for database objects like tables, views, stages, file formats,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
functions, and stored procedures. Think of it as a folder within a database that helps organize these objects.

crucial aspect is that a schema always belongs to a single database. You cannot have a schema spanning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
across multiple databases in Snowflake. This organizational structure helps in managing and securing

Option B is incorrect because schemas are designed to reside within a single database. Option C describes a

D is inaccurate as it defines a Snowflake account, which is a distinct entity from a schema and represents the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
entire computing environment for a customer within the Snowflake platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, the fundamental purpose of a schema is to logically group objects within a database, making it

Option B is correct because a database in Snowflake acts as a container for schemas. Schemas are the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
organizational units within a database. A single database can house multiple schemas, allowing for the logical                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
separation of database objects like tables, views, and stored procedures. This is a core design principle for

Option C is correct because a schema serves as a namespace and a logical grouping mechanism for database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
objects. By creating separate schemas, you can group related tables, views, and other objects together,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
improving organization, maintainability, and security. For example, you might have schemas for different                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
departments (e.g., sales, marketing) or different types of data (e.g., raw data, processed data).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option A is incorrect because the relationship between databases and schemas is hierarchical in the opposite

Schemas are within databases, not the other way around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option D is incorrect because schemas are metadata constructs and not directly related to virtual

Virtual warehouses provide the compute resources for querying and manipulating data, but the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
schema defines the organization of the data itself. The virtual warehouse used for a query can access objects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
in any schema to which the user has permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option E is incorrect because tables are contained within a specific schema. A table cannot span multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
schemas. Data can be accessed across schemas, but the table definition resides in only one.

data storage costs for short-lived tables in Snowflake:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Temporary Tables:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Temporary tables exist only within the session in which they were created and are automatically dropped at                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
the end of the session. This means that the data they contain is not persisted beyond the session, eliminating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
any long-term storage costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Since temporary tables are session-specific, they provide data isolation and prevent conflicts between                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
different users or processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The immediate deletion of temporary tables at session end ensures automatic cleanup, reducing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
administrative overhead associated with managing storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Their volatility makes them ideal for storing data needed only for the duration of a specific query or task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Transient Tables:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Transient tables are similar to permanent tables but do not have a Fail-safe period. Fail-safe provides a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
historical data recovery period (typically 7 days) after Time Travel has expired. Without Fail-safe, the storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
costs associated with historical data versions are eliminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Transient tables have a Time Travel period (up to 1 day for Enterprise Edition, and 0 days for Standard Edition),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
but it's shorter than permanent tables (up to 90 days). A shorter Time Travel means less storage is consumed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
for historical data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Transient tables offer a balance between data persistence and cost efficiency, suitable for data that needs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
persist across sessions but doesn't require long-term recovery options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Transient tables are automatically dropped when the user account is deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Permanent Tables: Permanent tables are designed for long-term data storage. They have Fail-safe and Time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Travel enabled, incurring higher storage costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Provisional Tables: There's no "Provisional Tables" object type in Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Lookup Tables: Lookup tables can be temporary, transient, or permanent, but are specifically designed for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
data lookup purposes not as general-purpose short-lived tables, so while a lookup table could technically be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
transient or temporary, it isn't a method of reducing storage costs specifically for short-lived tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
In summary, temporary tables eliminate storage costs by only existing within a session, and transient tables

The correct answer is A. A User-Defined Table Function (UDTF) because UDTFs are specifically designed to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
return a set of rows, which is precisely what the FROM clause in an SQL query expects. The FROM clause                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
needs a source that provides tabular data, and UDTFs fulfill this requirement. Unlike scalar UDFs, which return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
a single value, UDTFs can generate multiple rows, effectively behaving like a table within the context of a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
query. This makes them suitable for use in the FROM clause, where data from tables or views are typically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
accessed. Scalar UDFs (option B) operate on individual rows and return a single value, making them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
inappropriate for direct use in the FROM clause. Stored procedures (option C) are primarily used for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
procedural logic and do not return data in a tabular format suitable for the FROM clause. Tasks (option D) are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
scheduling objects that execute SQL or stored procedures and are not directly queryable. Therefore, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
ability of UDTFs to produce tabular data aligns with the expectations of the FROM clause, making them the

The correct answers are A. ALTER TAG and C. DROP TAG. These are the primary Data Definition Language                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
(DDL) commands in Snowflake used to manage tags. Tags in Snowflake are metadata objects that allow you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
to categorize and manage data assets and other Snowflake objects. ALTER TAG enables modifications to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
existing tags, such as changing the allowed values for a tag, or modifying the tag’s comment. DROP TAG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
facilitates the removal of tags from the Snowflake environment. Unlike Data Manipulation Language (DML)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
which focuses on data within tables, DDL commands like ALTER and DROP deal with the structure and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
schema of database objects themselves. Option B, DESCRIBE TAG, is a useful command, but it is not a DDL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
command. Rather, it is a command to view information about the tag. Similarly, GRANT ... TO TAG and GRANT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
TAG (options D and E) are related to access control, managed through Data Control Language (DCL), not DDL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Tags themselves are database objects, and their manipulation (alteration or removal) is handled using DDL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Options D and E relate to privilege management rather than object management.

this unstructured data within Snowflake, you utilize a directory table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
A directory table functions as a metadata layer on top of the external storage. It provides a structured view of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the files in the external stage. When you create a directory table associated with an external stage containing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
unstructured data, Snowflake automatically populates the table with information about the files, such as file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
name, size, last modified timestamp, and the relative path to the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
This metadata allows you to query and work with the unstructured data without needing to ingest the entire                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
file into Snowflake. Instead, you can use SQL to query the directory table and retrieve information about

It is crucial to understand that directory tables do not store the unstructured data itself; they store metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
about the data residing in cloud storage. Therefore, Directory tables are a requirement for handling

Snowflake. In Snowflake, a database is the top-level container, and it serves as a logical grouping of related                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
schemas. Each database can house one or more schemas, and these schemas act as namespaces for tables,

Snowflake's tag properties, specifically ALLOWED_VALUES, impose a limit on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
number of distinct string values you can define for a single tag. This limitation exists to maintain performance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
and prevent resource exhaustion when processing and storing tag metadata. While tags themselves provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
powerful mechanisms for classifying and organizing data, overly extensive allowed value sets could lead to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
significant overhead. The maximum permitted number of values is indeed 50, not 10, 64, or 256.

restriction encourages careful planning and selection of tag values, promoting efficient data management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within the Snowflake environment. Exceeding this limit will result in an error during tag creation or

The choice of 50 as the limit is a balance between providing sufficient flexibility for most

The ALLOWED_VALUES property is critical for enforcing data governance and consistent

The correct answer is B. Stage objects in Snowflake can be created as temporary. Temporary objects in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake are session-specific and automatically dropped at the end of the session. This means they only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
exist for the duration of the user's connection and don't persist beyond that. This feature is especially useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
for intermediate data storage during processing or loading, where permanent storage is not required,

Stages in Snowflake are named locations that point to internal locations or external storage (like Amazon S3,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) where data files are stored. When creating a stage, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
TEMPORARY keyword can be used, specifically when defining an internal stage. This distinction is crucial;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
external stages, which point to external locations, cannot be created as temporary. They are persistent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
metadata records that Snowflake relies on for accessing data in those locations.

integrations, in contrast to stages, are not meant to be temporary objects as their lifecycles often span

The benefit of temporary stages is that data loaded or staged in them during a session is automatically

These definitions, however, do not lead to data

FOREIGN KEY constraints are also not enforced as they would

These constraints would typically enforce referential integrity, and

The correct answer is B. Database and C. Schema. In Snowflake, a namespace uniquely identifies an object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within the system. This identification is hierarchical and is structured using a multi-level approach. The top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
level of this hierarchy is the database, which serves as a logical container for schemas. Schemas, the next                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
level down, are themselves containers for various database objects, such as tables, views, and procedures.Together, the database and schema act as a combined entity that provides a unique namespace where objects                                                                                                                                                                 
are stored and referenced. This layered structure ensures that object names are not only unique but also                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
logically grouped. Without the database and schema combination, object names could clash, particularly in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
scenarios where multiple users or applications access a single Snowflake account. This organization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
promotes clarity and efficient access control. Specifying both the database and schema in a qualified name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
(e.g., DATABASE.SCHEMA.OBJECT) guarantees that the intended object is located regardless of which role is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
currently active or other contextual settings. Therefore, only a combination of a database and a schema

The correct answer is A: Snowflake tables are logical representations of underlying physical data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
This is because Snowflake employs a separation of compute and storage.

data types. However, the actual data is stored and managed separately in Snowflake's proprietary

Option B is incorrect because tables are not the physical instantiation. Instead, they are

Option C is incorrect because while clustering keys can improve query performance, they are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
mandatory for a table to function optimally. You can create and use tables without ever defining a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
clustering key. Tables still operate perfectly well and can be queried without these keys, though                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
some queries might be slower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Option D is incorrect since tables are not owned by a user but a database or schema. Users have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
privileges on tables, allowing them to access or modify data, but they don't "own" the table itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
It's an object within the Snowflake account and not assigned to a specific user.

features like time travel and zero-copy cloning. You can query old data or create cloned tables

Here's a detailed explanation why the correct answer is A. Secure views in Snowflake, unlike                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
other table-like objects, do not consume storage costs because they do not store any data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Instead, a secure view acts as a virtual table, dynamically querying and presenting data from its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
underlying base tables each time it is accessed. This behavior is similar to a standard view but

Materialized views, however, do store precomputed results and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
thus incur storage costs for the replicated data. Temporary tables, created within a user session,

costs are typically temporary. Transient tables, while not intended for permanent storage like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
standard tables, also consume storage; they lack the fail-safe protections of permanent tables,

The 'virtual' nature of secure views prevents them from storing persistent

The data accessed via secure views is

Snowsight, Snowflake's modern web interface, provides tools for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
managing and interacting with data. Worksheets serve as the primary interface for writing and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
executing SQL queries, while the database explorer allows browsing the structure of databases,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
schemas, and tables. Critically, worksheets can be organized for better manageability and access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
within Snowsight. Option B states the ability to move a worksheet to a folder or a dashboard,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
which is a core function for organizational purposes. Users can indeed group worksheets into                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
folders to categorize them based on function, project, or other criteria. Additionally, worksheets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
can be integrated into dashboards, making it easy to combine multiple queries and visualizationswithin a single interactive view. Conversely, the other options are incorrect: A refers to user                                                                                                                                                                                     
management, not worksheet organization, which is handled in different areas of Snowsight. C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
suggests combining worksheets, which isn’t a native feature; you may copy and paste code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
between worksheets, but not combine them directly. D implies tagging worksheets, but the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
specific functionality is folder management, which is the organization described in B. Therefore, B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
is the correct response as it represents a built-in feature of worksheet and explorer management

The correct answer is A. CREATE TABLE LIKE TABLE_A;. This is because the CREATE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
TABLE LIKE statement in Snowflake is specifically designed to clone the structure and

importantly, its tags. This inherent behavior of the LIKE clause ensures that the new                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
table automatically inherits any tags associated with the source table.

In essence, CREATE TABLE LIKE is the only command among the options designed for

Dynamic Data Masking in Snowflake is a powerful feature that allows for the selective                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
obfuscation of sensitive data based on user roles and policies, enhancing data security

The primary goal is to restrict access to sensitive data while still                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
enabling users to work with it. Dynamic masking applies only to the data returned by

Dynamic data masking is directly supported on two primary types of objects: Tables and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Views. Tables are the foundation for storing raw data, and masking policies can be

However, the Snowflake metadata about external tables does incur Fail-safe

Temporary tables are designed for short-term data storage within a single session. They                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
are automatically dropped at the end of the session in which they were created, so they                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
don't incur Fail-safe costs. However, they don't fulfill the requirement of storing data

Transient tables, on the other hand, provide a middle ground. They persist data beyond a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
single session (like permanent tables), but they do not have Fail-safe. This makes them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
ideal for data that requires persistence but is less critical and doesn't warrant the Failsafe protection and associated costs. Transient tables have a user-defined data                                                                                                                                                                                                           
retention period (up to 1 day), after which historical data is not recoverable through Time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Travel or Fail-safe. If the data is corrupted or lost, you won't be able to rely on fail-safe to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
recover it. Because there is no fail-safe, this satisfies the prompt requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Therefore, Transient tables are the only option that allows data to be stored beyond a
