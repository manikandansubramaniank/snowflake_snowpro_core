The correct answer is B. Warehouse size and D. # of clusters for the Warehouse. Snowflake's compute layer,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
which is composed of virtual warehouses, consumes credits based on the resources used, primarily compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
power and time. Warehouse size directly impacts credit consumption. Larger warehouses, which provide more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
compute resources, consume credits at a higher rate per unit of time compared to smaller warehouses. This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
because a larger size means more CPU and memory allocated, translating to greater processing capability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
and therefore a higher charge. The number of clusters also plays a critical role, as a multi-cluster warehouse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
will consume more credits than a single-cluster one. Each active cluster within a multi-cluster warehouse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
incurs charges in proportion to its size and the duration it's running. The amount of data processed (option C)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
affects the duration a warehouse runs, but the actual rate of credit consumption is determined by the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
warehouse's size and the number of active clusters. The number of users (option A) is irrelevant to direct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
credit consumption. While user activity drives warehouse usage, it's the compute resources that consume                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
credits, not the users themselves. A warehouse can be idle and not consuming credits even with many                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
connected users. In summary, Snowflake charges for the capacity it dedicates (warehouse size and clusters)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
and the duration the resources are active, not necessarily for the amount of data or connected users.

Snowflake allocates compute resources to execute that query. These resources consume credits, which are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
then billed to the consumer account associated with the Reader Account. Data sharing itself does not incur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
direct charges to the provider. However, the provider is typically responsible for compute used for staging,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
cleaning, or transforming the data before sharing. Reader Accounts, therefore, shift the cost of querying the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
shared data to the consumer, not eliminating compute costs altogether. Essentially, someone has to pay for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
the compute resources required to execute queries, and in the case of Reader Accounts, it's the consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The provider still bears storage costs for the shared data.

Snowflake's serverless features, like serverless tasks and snowpipes, operate on a consumption-based billing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
model. Instead of charging for provisioned resources like virtual warehouses, you are billed based on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
actual compute resources consumed during the execution of these serverless operations. This model aligns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
with the principles of serverless computing, where users don't manage underlying infrastructure.Specifically, Snowflake measures consumption in terms of "compute seconds". The system dynamically                                                                                                                                                                                         
adjusts the compute resources allocated to each serverless job, automatically scaling up or down based on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the job's needs. This automatic sizing is reflected in the billing calculation. The billing is done on a per-second                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
basis, providing granular cost tracking. This means that you only pay for the exact duration of compute used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The other options are incorrect because the compute size is automatically determined and is not based on a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
SERVERLESS_FEATURES_SIZE account parameter (as stated in option C), and the cost is calculated for every                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
second of processing and no minimum time is applied (option B). Option D is incorrect as serverless features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
are always billed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The billing is thus directly proportional to the resources used per second by the serverless functionality and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
there is no minimum billing in minutes. This pay-as-you-go approach provides cost optimization, where users

The correct answer is C. SELECT MIN(ORDER_AMT) FROM SALES;. This operation can often be completed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
without requiring compute resources in Snowflake, thanks to its metadata management and optimization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
techniques. Snowflake stores extensive metadata about tables, including pre-computed statistics such asminimum and maximum values for columns. When a query requests the minimum value, Snowflake can                                                                                                                                                                                      
frequently retrieve this directly from the metadata cache without having to scan the underlying data files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
This avoids the need to spin up a virtual warehouse (compute). Options A, B, and D, on the other hand, require                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
processing the data records. SUM (A) and AVG (B) demand calculations across multiple rows, while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
ORDER_AMT * ORDER_QTY (D) necessitates computation for each record. Therefore, these queries require a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
virtual warehouse and active compute resources to perform these data transformations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The key distinction lies in Snowflakeâ€™s ability to derive MIN from cached metadata. The other operations are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
more complex aggregations or calculations. If the query is run without any prior query on the table, these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
aggregation operations will all require the virtual warehouse to activate and perform the work. However, given                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
that metadata is constantly updated by Snowflake, when these queries have been executed previously, some

The correct answer is AE because Snowflake's cloud services layer incurs costs when its usage exceeds 10%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
of the compute credits consumed within the same billing period. Scenarios A and E demonstrate this. In                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
scenario A, with 50 compute credits and 10 cloud service credits, the cloud service consumption percentage is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20% (10/50 100), exceeding the 10% threshold. Therefore, the customer would be billed for the cloud service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
usage beyond the 10% provided for free. In scenario E, with 200 compute credits and 26 cloud service credits,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the cloud service percentage is 13% (26/200 100), also going over the 10% free allowance. Scenarios B, C, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
D, however, show cloud service costs below the 10% limit; in scenario B cloud service is 6.25% (5/80 100); in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
scenario C is 9% (9/100 100); and in scenario D it is approximately 8.3% (10/120 * 100). Thus, in those cases,users would not be separately charged for cloud service costs because those costs are covered by the

Here's a detailed breakdown of the compute time calculation for the given scenario:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1. Initial State: The warehouse is suspended and auto-resume is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2. First Query (3 minutes): When the user runs the first query, the warehouse resumes. The query takes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
3 minutes to complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Billable time starts when the warehouse begins resuming (which is quick in most scenarios but should                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
be noted as time spent towards resuming as well).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3. Idle Time (15 minutes): The user leaves for 15 minutes. The auto-suspend setting is 10 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Therefore, after 10 minutes of inactivity after the 3-minute query finishes, the warehouse suspends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The warehouse runs for 3 minutes + 10 minutes = 13 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
4. Second Query (10 seconds): The user returns and runs another query. Since the warehouse was                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
suspended during the idle time, it must resume. This adds to the billable time. The query takes 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
seconds to complete. Since Snowflake bills in whole minutes, the warehouse will run for the 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
seconds and be billed for 1 additional minute to satisfy Snowflake's minimum billing increment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
It is important to realize there is billable time associated with the restart as well. The exact time is not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
given but the restart may take up to 60 seconds. If this time is included as an average the extra time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
is between 0-1 minute for billing purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5. Manual Suspension: The user manually suspends the warehouse immediately after the second

The correct answer is C: No costs will be incurred as the query will use metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ... command in Snowflake creates a new table with the same structure (column

It merely replicates the

Because it only involves manipulating metadata â€“ information about the table's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
structure rather than the actual data within it â€“ the operation is very efficient and doesn't necessitate the use

Since there is no data transfer or processing involved, there are no compute costs associated with running a

Therefore, option A and D are incorrect as those costs are based on virtual warehouse

Moreover, since no data is being duplicated, no additional storage is required. Option B suggests storage

Only metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
storage is affected, which is minimal and typically not noticeable. The cost for storing metadata is negligible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
compared to the cost of storing data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
In summary, the operation is lightweight and primarily leverages the metadata layer within Snowflake.

The correct answer is D: Credits are consumed based on the warehouse size and the time the warehouse is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
running. This is because Snowflake uses credits to measure the consumption of compute resources, which are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
primarily driven by virtual warehouses. The size of the warehouse directly impacts the number of credits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
consumed per hour. Larger warehouses provide more compute power and therefore consume more credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The longer the warehouse runs, the more credits are consumed proportionally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option A is incorrect. While Snowflake bills in per-second usage with a 60-second minimum, it's not a perminute minimum as stated in the option. Snowflake charges for the actual usage based on per-second                                                                                                                                                                                
granularity with the initial 60 seconds after warehouse startup being the minimum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option B is incorrect because cloud data storage usage is billed separately from compute resources, based on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
the volume of data stored and the retention period. Storage costs are generally expressed in terms of cost per                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
terabyte per month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option C is only partially correct but misleading.

warehouse runs is relevant, the consumption is determined by both the size and the actual running time, not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
just a pre-determined hourly billing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, the most accurate statement is that credits are consumed based on the warehouse size and the

This reflects the core principle of Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
compute resources. The larger the warehouse and the longer it runs, the more credits you will consume.

Here's why: Virtual warehouse credits in Snowflake are primarily consumed by compute activities. Virtual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
warehouses represent the processing power used to execute queries and data loading/unloading tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Running a custom query (D) necessitates the virtual warehouse to process data, filter results, and perform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
computations as defined in the query. The more complex the query, the more computational resources are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
utilized, and thus, more credits are consumed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Running COPY commands (E) involves loading data into Snowflake tables or unloading data from Snowflake

This process requires significant computational effort for parsing, transforming,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
and transferring data, directly impacting virtual warehouse utilization and, consequently, credit consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Caching query results (A) is a function of Snowflake's metadata and result caching mechanism.

The correct answer is B. Spilling. Spilling in Snowflake, and in the broader context of data processing, refers

This mechanism is essential for handling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
large datasets that would otherwise cause queries to fail due to memory constraints. When memory is

While spilling can prevent outright failures, it significantly impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
query performance as disk I/O is much slower than in-memory operations. This is because reading and writing

"Pruning" (A) refers to optimizing query performance by filtering out unnecessary data partitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
"Join explosion" (C) is a situation where a join operation results in a large, unexpected increase in row count.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
"Queue overloading" (D) describes a scenario where too many queries are waiting to be executed by available

While the query in this scenario only runs for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
36 seconds, Snowflake charges for a minimum of one minute (60 seconds) of warehouse usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is because starting and stopping a warehouse consumes resources, thus the one-minute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
minimum. A 2XL virtual warehouse consumes 64 credits per hour when actively running. However,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the question is tricking the reader, as the question doesn't state the warehouse is running on 2XL,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
the question only states the size of the warehouse is 2XL which indicates an expected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
consumption of 32 credits per hour. Since a 2XL warehouse consumes 32 credits per hour, and we                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
need to calculate the minimum usage of 60 seconds (1 minute) this is the correct rate we use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, Snowflake will charge for 60 seconds of usage at the rate of 32 credits per hour. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
means that even though the query itself ran for less than a minute, the minimum charge is for a

Options A and B are incorrect because they don't
