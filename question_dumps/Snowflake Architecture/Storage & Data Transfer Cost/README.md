<strong>C</strong>                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
The provided answer, C (Database replication), is correct. Egress charges in cloud computing, including                           
Snowflake, refer to the cost associated with data leaving the cloud provider's environment. Database                              
replication involves copying data from one Snowflake account or region to another. This transfer of data out                      
of the initial Snowflake environment incurs egress charges.                                                                       
Option A (Data sharing within a specific region) does not typically incur egress charges because the data                         
remains within the same region's infrastructure. Snowflake's internal network handles data transfers within a                     
region efficiently, avoiding the costs associated with data leaving their network boundary.                                       
Option B (Query result retrieval) can incur egress charges, depending on where the client retrieving the data is                  
located. If the client is outside the Snowflake region, data needs to be transferred out of Snowflake's                           
infrastructure, generating egress charges. However, database replication is inherently egress-focused (the                        
entire database is being moved out) and thus is a more consistently significant cause of egress charges.                          
Option D (Loading data into Snowflake) involves ingress, not egress. Data is being transferred into the                           
Snowflake environment, not out of it. Ingress is often free or significantly less expensive than egress in cloud                  
computing models.                                                                                                                 
Therefore, database replication presents the most substantial and direct use case for Snowflake applying                          
egress charges because it necessitates the transfer of large volumes of data out of the Snowflake                                 
environment. While query retrieval can involve egress, it's contingent on the client's location. Replication, on                  
the other hand, inherently relies on data exiting Snowflake's controlled region.                                                  
For more information about Snowflake's data transfer costs and egress charges, you can refer to the official                      
Snowflake documentation:                                                                                                          
Snowflake Cost Optimization: https://www.snowflake.com/guides/cost-optimization/ (search for terms like                           
"data transfer" and "egress")                                                                                                     
Snowflake Data Replication: (consult Snowflake documentation and resources on replication for details                             
about involved costs.)                                                                                                            
Although a direct single page link detailing egress costs specifically for replication is difficult to provide                    
(Snowflake's documentation is structured around services), exploring the "Data Replication" and "Cost                             
Optimization" sections within their documentation will lead you to relevant information.
