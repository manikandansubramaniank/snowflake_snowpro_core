Resource monitors in Snowflake are designed to manage and control the consumption of compute resources,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
preventing unexpected cost overruns. They achieve this by tracking the credit usage of virtual warehouses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
and triggering specific actions when predefined limits are reached. The core functionality revolves around                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
sending notifications and, crucially, taking actions to limit or stop further resource consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option A, "Alert," is not a direct action. While notifications might be used in an alerting system, it isn’t the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
name of a specific action of the resource monitor. Option B, "Notify," is correct. Resource monitors can be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
configured to send email notifications when certain thresholds are met. This keeps administrators informed ofconsumption patterns. Option C, "Notify and suspend," is also correct. Resource monitors can be set to not                                                                                                                                                                                                      
only send notifications but also to automatically suspend assigned warehouses when limits are reached,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
thereby halting further credit expenditure. Option D, "Abort," is incorrect. There's no "abort" action. Option E,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
"Suspend immediately," is not the full action, although it's part of the "notify and suspend" action.

resource monitor does not simply suspend the warehouse. It provides a notification in advance of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
suspension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Therefore, the correct actions supported by Snowflake resource monitors are 'Notify' and 'Notify and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
suspend'.

The correct answer is A, indicating that only one resource monitor can be directly assigned at the account

Snowflake resource monitors are crucial for controlling credit consumption. While multiple resource monitors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
can exist within a Snowflake account, their primary purpose is to manage credit usage for individual virtual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
warehouses. Think of the account-level assignment as a global default setting.The assignment of a single resource monitor at the account level acts as a safeguard, applying credit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
consumption limits to all warehouses not explicitly assigned a resource monitor.

uncontrolled credit spending doesn't occur unexpectedly across the entire Snowflake account, even when

Consider scenarios where new warehouses are created but not immediately linked to a dedicated resource

The account-level monitor will immediately begin tracking and limiting their credit consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Without this account-level assignment, newly created warehouses could potentially consume credits without

The correct answer is B. One. A crucial aspect of managing costs and resource consumption in Snowflake is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the use of resource monitors. These monitors allow administrators to set credit quotas and trigger actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
when usage approaches or exceeds those limits. Importantly, a single virtual warehouse in Snowflake can

This relationship ensures clear and controlled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
monitoring of that specific warehouse's resource consumption. This design choice simplifies resource

The correct answer is B. Creating resource monitors. Resource monitors in Snowflake are specifically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
designed to control and limit credit consumption within an account. They allow administrators to set quotas on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
credits used by warehouses, users, and the entire account. Once a set limit is reached, resource monitors can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
trigger actions such as suspending a warehouse or sending notifications, preventing further unexpected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
credit charges. This contrasts with other options: Tracking usage (A) provides insight but doesn’t impose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
limits, automatic warehouse scaling (C) dynamically adjusts warehouse size based on workload, which can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
increase or decrease credit consumption, and automatic clustering (D) optimizes data storage and query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
performance but doesn’t directly restrict credit usage.

They also don't directly manage cloud services (C), but control warehouse usage,

The correct answer is C. When a resource monitor triggers a "Notify & Suspend" action,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
it is designed to inform account administrators and then halt warehouse activity.

the "Notify" portion sends an alert notification. Critically, this notification is specifically

This ensures that the people with the authority to manage resources

Then, the "Suspend" portion of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
action puts associated warehouses into a suspended state. Importantly, the suspension

This prevents

Option B is incorrect because it incorrectly states

Option D is incorrect as the warehouses are not suspended immediately but rather after

Option B is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
incorrect because virtual warehouse storage is automatically managed by Snowflake;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
users do not allocate storage manually, and resource monitors cannot influence that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option C is also incorrect because resource monitors have no control over queries; that

Option D is correct. A key function of a resource monitor is to allow you to set credit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
limits for virtual warehouses (and other objects) and to specify an action, such assuspending the warehouse, if a certain credit threshold is reached. This allows for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
automated cost control. Option E is also correct. Resource monitors can send
