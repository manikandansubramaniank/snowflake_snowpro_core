The correct answer is A: The Pipe load history is reset to empty. When a Snowflake Pipe is recreated using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE, it essentially drops the existing Pipe and creates a new one with the same name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
and definition. A crucial aspect of a Pipe's operation is its load history, which tracks which files have already                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
been ingested to prevent duplicate data loading. This history is stored internally and is tied to the specific                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Pipe instance. When a Pipe is replaced, this internal history is not carried over to the new instance. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
the newly created Pipe starts with a clean slate, having no record of previously loaded files. This reset means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
that if the same source data files are still present in the external stage, the new Pipe, unaware of previous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
loads, may ingest them again, leading to potential data duplication. Option B is incorrect because the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
REFRESH parameter isn't directly associated with the replacement of a Pipe but rather with manual refreshes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
of materialized views. Option C is misleading; while the Pipe starts with no load history, it will not "ignore"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
previously loaded files if they are present and trigger a load event. Therefore, only the first option accurately

The statement is False. Snowpipe, when utilizing the REST API, isn't solely restricted to External Stages as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
data sources. While External Stages (like S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) are a common                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
use case for Snowpipe, the REST API's flexibility allows it to ingest data from other sources as well.Specifically, the API can send data directly in the request body, effectively bypassing the need for prestaging in an external location. This means data can be streamed directly from a client application to                                                              
Snowflake. The REST API interaction involves pushing data in a structured JSON format, which is then parsed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and loaded into the targeted Snowflake tables. The pipe configuration itself determines the target tables and

Therefore, the REST API method of loading data via Snowpipe provides more

Snowflake and a key aspect of its ease of use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option D is correct: A fundamental function of Snowpipe is to track which files have already been loaded,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
avoiding duplicate ingestion. This is critical for ensuring data integrity in a continuous loading scenario. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
internal tracking mechanism prevents the same data from being loaded multiple times, even if files are resubmitted or appear multiple times in the stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option A is incorrect: Snowpipe via REST API can load data from both internal (Snowflake-managed) stages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
and external stages (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage). The choice of stage location doesn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
restrict REST API usage. Therefore, this is a key capability of Snowpipe and a strong driver for utilizing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
external stages to ingest from external data lakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option B is incorrect: While Snowpipe utilizes COPY INTO commands, not all COPY INTO options are available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
during pipe creation. Some options, such as those related to specific transformations, might require additional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
considerations or alternative implementation via other mechanisms or features. Therefore, it is important to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
understand the available options in pipe creation and limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
In summary, Snowpipe with the REST API leverages a serverless approach for data loading (C) and maintains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
meticulous tracking of ingested files to ensure data quality (D). It is not limited to internal stages (A), and doesnot offer full feature parity with all COPY INTO options (B).

The correct answer is A. True. Snowflake Pipes, used for continuous data ingestion, can indeed be suspended                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and resumed. This capability is crucial for managing data loading processes effectively. Suspending a pipehalts the automatic ingestion of data from the specified stage, preventing new files from being loaded into

Resuming a pipe brings it back online, allowing it to start processing new data from the stage

The recommended compressed file size for Snowpipe data loading in Snowflake is indeed 100-250 MB. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
range represents a balance between minimizing the number of files to manage (larger files) and enabling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
efficient parallel processing by Snowflake's compute resources (smaller files). Smaller files can lead to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
excessive overhead due to the management and processing of numerous individual files, potentially slowing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
down the load process. Conversely, overly large files can hinder parallel processing, reduce throughput, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
increase the time it takes to load data. The 100-250 MB range allows Snowflake to distribute the workload                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
across multiple virtual warehouses, maximizing concurrency. Files within this size also improve network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
throughput efficiency. It also allows for better error isolation, as a failure loading a smaller file will have less                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
impact than failure of a massive one. While larger files up to a maximum size are supported by Snowflake,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
sticking to the recommended range ensures that performance is optimized and resource utilization remains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
efficient. This also aligns with the general best practices in data warehousing where batch processing is

Snowpipe processes data in micro-batches, and files within this size range allow these batches to

The most efficient way to load frequently arriving data files into Snowflake from cloud storage is to leverage

manual intervention and continuous polling. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Snowpipe automates the data loading process as soon as new files arrive in the cloud storage location. Autoingest uses cloud provider event notifications, such as AWS SQS/SNS for S3, Azure Event Grid for Azure Blob

new file lands, the cloud provider service sends a notification to a Snowflake-managed queue. Snowpipe then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
consumes these notifications and initiates the data loading process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
This method is highly efficient because it is event-driven. Snowflake doesn't waste resources continuously                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
polling the storage location for new files. It only reacts when a notification is received, which minimizes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
latency and costs. Task-based solutions involving COPY INTO or PUT/GET operations (options A, B, and C)

They also add                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
overhead through the repeated execution of tasks. PUT operations are generally used for smaller files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The task that executes GET operation would be highly inefficient as it needs to check for new files without

external stage. The task that PUTs files in an internal stage would involve transferring files out of cloud

This recommendation stems from the efficiency of Snowpipe in handling a moderate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
number of relatively sized files. While Snowpipe can technically load larger files, splitting the data into files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
within this recommended size range optimizes throughput and cost.Smaller files, below 100MB, can lead to increased overhead due to the processing required for each individual                                                                                                                                                                                                    
file. Snowpipe incurs a per-file processing cost, and having numerous small files increases this overhead,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
potentially impacting performance and increasing cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Conversely, significantly larger files (greater than 250MB, especially those in the GB range) can lead to

While Snowpipe can process large files, breaking them down into smaller chunks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
allows for greater parallelism and efficient resource utilization within the Snowflake platform. Large files also

The correct answer is A, a Pipe. Snowflake Pipes are designed for continuous data loading from external                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
stages. They provide an automated mechanism that detects new data files in a cloud storage location, such as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage, and loads them into Snowflake tables. This automated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
process is triggered whenever new files are detected, eliminating the need for manual loading. Pipes leverage

Unlike external stages (B),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
which merely point to the storage location, Pipes facilitate the actual loading operation. Tasks (C) can

The correct answer is C. A single COPY_INTO statement. Snowpipe is designed to automatically ingest data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
from cloud storage into Snowflake tables based on file arrival. It achieves this by leveraging a pipe object that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
references a stage and a COPY statement. Specifically, Snowpipe's core functionality revolves around

Snowpipe is Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service, designed to load data in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
near real-time as soon as it's available in cloud storage. File size significantly impacts Snowpipe's efficiency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
and cost. Smaller files generate more metadata and require more individual processing tasks, increasing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
overhead and potential latency. Conversely, excessively large files might overwhelm the system and slow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
down processing due to memory constraints or processing time per file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Snowflake recommends a compressed file size range to optimize both ingestion speed and costeffectiveness. Files within the 100-250 MB range generally strike a balance by minimizing metadata overheadwhile still allowing for parallel processing within the Snowpipe framework. This size allows Snowflake to                                                                   
efficiently distribute the workload across available compute resources. Using files smaller than 100 MB leads                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
to a higher number of individual pipeline executions, each incurring associated costs for metadata

The most efficient way to load streaming data into Snowflake is by utilizing Snowpipe. Snowpipe is designed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
for automated, continuous data ingestion, making it ideal for streaming scenarios. It leverages cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
messaging services (like Amazon SQS, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, or Azure Event Grid) to trigger data loads as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
soon as new data files become available in a cloud storage stage. This near real-time ingestion eliminates the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
need for manual or scheduled data loading processes, significantly reducing latency. COPY command, while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
suitable for bulk loading, requires manual invocation and is not optimized for continuous streams. The Load                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Data Wizard is a user-interface tool for one-time or small-scale loading, not for high-volume streaming data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
While tasks and streams can be used for data processing after ingestion, they aren't the primary mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
for ingesting streaming data directly into Snowflake. Snowpipe's architecture directly addresses the needs of

14 days prior. This limit is not configurable by the user and is a default retention policy within Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Understanding the 14-day limit is essential for planning audits, data reconciliation tasks, and setting up alerts.

The correct answer is A and D: Cloud messaging and REST endpoints. Snowpipe, Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
continuous data ingestion service, relies on external signals to trigger the loading process. Cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
messaging services (A), such as AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub, or Azure Queue Storage, are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
commonly used. When new data files are staged, a message is sent to the designated queue,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
signaling Snowpipe to initiate the load. This event-driven architecture ensures that data is loaded                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
as soon as it's available. REST endpoints (D) also provide a mechanism for triggering Snowpipe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
These endpoints allow external applications or scripts to send HTTP requests to notify Snowpipe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
of new staged files. This method allows for programmatic control over the ingestion process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Email integrations (B) and error notifications (C) are not mechanisms that initiate data loading but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
rather tools for notifications about data loading and potential issues. Snowsight interactions (E)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
are used for data analysis and management, not for triggering data loading operations within

The correct answer is C. CREATE PIPE. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake's CREATE PIPE command is explicitly designed to facilitate continuous data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
loading. A pipe acts as an automated process that continuously monitors a specified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
stage (an area where your data files are stored, such as an S3 bucket) for new files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
When new data files are detected, the pipe automatically initiates a COPY INTO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
operation to load that data into the target table. This eliminates the need for manual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
intervention or scheduled batch jobs, ensuring near real-time ingestion as data becomes

core concept involves detecting new or updated files in the cloud storage location and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
automatically loading them into the target table based on a predefined COPY statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
within the pipe definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
C. Use of the insertFiles REST endpoint: This is a direct trigger. Snowflake provides the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
insertFiles REST API endpoint specifically for signaling to a pipe that new data files are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
available and ready to be ingested. When called, the pipe is notified and starts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
processing the files. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sqlreference/functions/pipe_status.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
E. Set the pipe parameter to auto-ingest: Enabling auto-ingest on a pipe is crucial. It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
configures the pipe to automatically detect and ingest files without requiring manual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
intervention. This relies on cloud messaging services (like AWS SQS, Azure Event Grid,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
or Google Cloud Pub/Sub) to notify Snowflake when new files arrive in the cloud storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
location. This eliminates the need for periodic manual triggering.https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-ingest.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Now, let's examine why the other options are incorrect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
A. Use of an INSERT statement: An INSERT statement is used for manually inserting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
data directly into a Snowflake table. It doesn't interact with or trigger a Snowpipe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
B. Use of a COPY INTO [table] statement: While COPY INTO is used within the pipe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
definition to specify how the data is loaded from the staged files, it is not the trigger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
itself. COPY INTO executes within the pipe's process after the pipe has been triggered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Manually running COPY INTO on the target table will load data but will bypass the pipe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
D.
