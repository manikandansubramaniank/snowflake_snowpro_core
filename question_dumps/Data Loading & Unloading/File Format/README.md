The PUT command in Snowflake is used to upload data files from a local file system to a Snowflake internal

Option C is correct because the PUT command, by default, automatically compresses files using Gzip during                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
the upload process. This helps reduce the storage space required for the files in the stage and improves

The compression behavior can be overridden by specifying the AUTO_COMPRESS = FALSE

Option D is also correct because the PUT command automatically encrypts the files during the upload to the

Snowflake encrypts all data at rest and in transit, and this applies to files uploaded using the PUT

This encryption provides data protection and security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option A is incorrect. The PUT command does not automatically create a File Format object. A File Format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
object must be created separately using the CREATE FILE FORMAT command before loading the data into a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
table. The file format specifies the structure and characteristics of the data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option B is incorrect because the PUT command does not automatically use the last Stage created. It needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
the stage name to be explicitly defined as part of the command itself. It can be an internal or external stage

The correct answer is True. While creating a named File Format object is often the recommended practice for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
reusable configurations and better management of data loading processes in Snowflake, it's not strictly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
mandatory for loading data. Snowflake's COPY INTO command allows for specifying file format options

This approach is particularly useful for ad-hoc

The correct answer is A, CSV. The COPY command in Snowflake, when used to load data from files, requires a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
file format to understand how the data is structured within those files. If no file format is explicitly specified in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
the command, Snowflake defaults to CSV. This default behavior simplifies initial data loading scenarios where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
common comma-separated values files are often used. Snowflake assumes that fields are delimited by

The other options are valid file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
formats for COPY commands but do not represent the default setting. Understanding this default helps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
ensure data is loaded correctly and avoid potential parsing errors. Specifying the file format explicitly remains

The provided answer (BCF) is incorrect. Snowflake supports several file formats for unloading data, but BCF is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
not one of them.

The correct answer is B. It removes the outer array structure and loads the records into separate table rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY file format option in Snowflake is specifically designed to handle JSON data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
structures that are wrapped within a top-level array. When a JSON document consists of a single, large array                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
containing multiple objects (records), loading it directly into a single row of a Snowflake table would result in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
nested data structures, making it difficult to query and analyze. STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY addresses this by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
automatically removing the enclosing array. Instead of loading the whole array as one entity, Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
iterates over each JSON object inside the array and treats each one as an independent record, loading them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
into separate rows of the target table. This transformation simplifies data access and manipulation. Without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
this option, the entire array would be considered a single value, requiring further processing to extract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
individual records. This is because Snowflake expects records to be in row format by default when loading                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
data. Option A is incorrect, as it does not only remove the last element, but the whole array; Option C is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
incorrect as it deals with removal of spaces, not array structures; and Option D is incorrect since

options allows users to explicitly override the default, but if omitted, UTF-8 is assumed. Other encodings like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
UTF-16, ISO 8859-1, or ANSI_X3.4 are not the default. UTF-16, while capable of representing the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
characters as UTF-8, is less efficient for mostly ASCII data. ISO 8859-1 is a single-byte encoding that can only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
represent a limited subset of characters, leading to potential data loss if the CSV file contains characters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
outside this range. Similarly, ANSI_X3.4 (ASCII) is even more restrictive. Utilizing UTF-8 as the default ensures

options are incorrect and why D is the most suitable response based on Snowflake's documentation and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
general principles.Option A is incorrect. Snowflake doesn't load files directly into tables. Files are staged first (either internal or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
external) and then copied into a table using the COPY INTO command. This two-step process provides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
flexibility and allows for data transformation during the load process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option B is incorrect because while Snowflake supports various delimiters, the default delimiter for delimited                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
files is a comma (,), not a semicolon. You can specify other delimiters if needed, but a comma is the standard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
when none is specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option C is incorrect. While Snowflake supports various semi-structured data formats like JSON, Avro, ORC,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Parquet, and XML, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is not directly a supported format. EDI often requires                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
significant pre-processing to convert it into a usable format before loading into Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Option D is correct because Snowflake defaults to UTF-8 encoding for delimited files. UTF-8 is a widely used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
character encoding standard that can represent characters from nearly all languages, ensuring broad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
compatibility. This default encoding minimizes issues related to character representation and data corruption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
during the loading process. Snowflake strives for ease of use, and UTF-8 as a default aligns with this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
minimizing the need for users to manually specify encoding unless they are working with a different character                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
set. Using UTF-8 ensures proper handling of international characters, contributing to data quality and

Other encodings are supported but require explicit specification.

The answer is C. CSV (Gzipped). Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
While Parquet (B) is generally superior for analytical queries within Snowflake due to its columnar storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
and encoding capabilities, CSV (Gzipped) excels in the loading phase. Compression, specifically gzip, plays a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
crucial role during data ingestion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Reduced Network Transfer Time: Gzip significantly reduces the file size of the CSV, leading to faster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
data transfer from the source (e.g., cloud storage like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud

2. Parallelism: Snowflake can efficiently decompress multiple gzipped files concurrently during the

accelerates the loading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3. Snowflake's Optimization: Snowflake is specifically designed to efficiently handle gzipped CSV files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
during loading. Its internal engine is optimized for this common scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
While Parquet's columnar format offers benefits for querying after the data is loaded, these advantages don't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
negate the substantial performance gains offered by gzipped CSV during the initial data loading phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Unzipped CSV (A) lacks the compression benefits, while ORC (D), although a columnar format similar to

Snowflake's data loading engine is optimized for rapidly parsing this basic format, allowing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
for quicker ingestion. Complex formats like Parquet require extra processing to extract data, which                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
slows down loading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Parallelism: Snowflake can effectively parallelize the loading of multiple CSV files simultaneously,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
further enhancing ingestion speed. This is especially true when loading from cloud storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3. Less Overhead: CSV files generally have less overhead than columnar formats during the initial load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
While formats like Parquet are more efficient after loading, the initial parsing and conversion can be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
slower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4. Direct Mapping: During the initial data loading, the fields are usually directly mapped from the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
columns in the CSV files to the table columns which is a relatively straightforward process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
However, it is crucial to understand that CSVs are not efficient for data storage or retrieval once loaded into                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Snowflake. Once the data is in Snowflake it will be converted to an internal format optimized for performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Columnar storage formats like Parquet, ORC and Avro, are designed for optimized query performance and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
data compression, they are better for other scenarios involving Snowflake external tables for querying data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
stored directly in cloud storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
It's crucial to clarify that: The question specifically asks about "data loading". In many other contexts, such as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
querying large datasets or building data lakes, Parquet would likely be the preferred option due to its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
columnar nature and advanced compression. For initial loading into Snowflake, however, CSV often comes out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
on top, especially for simpler datasets where the initial parsing speed becomes a significant factor.

Parquet, a columnar storage file format, is the most suitable choice for preserving floating-point number data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
values during data unloading in Snowflake. Unlike row-oriented formats such as CSV or JSON, Parquet storesdata by columns, which allows for more efficient compression and encoding of numeric data, specifically

The correct answer is B. GET_PRESIGNED_URL. Let's break down why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The core requirement is to obtain a URL for accessing a file on a Snowflake stage without the need for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
authentication and authorization during the subsequent access using that URL. This directly points to the

A pre-signed URL grants temporary access to a specific object (in this case, a file on a stage) without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
requiring the user to possess Snowflake credentials. The URL itself contains embedded authorization

GET_RELATIVE_PATH (option A) retrieves the relative path to a file within a stage, not a URL that provides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
access to the file. It's primarily used for internal file identification within Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
BUILD_STAGE_FILE_URL (option C) constructs a URL for accessing a file on a stage, but it generally requiresauthentication and authorization as it doesnâ€™t intrinsically embed access credentials. It's more for internal use                                                                                                                                                        
within the Snowflake environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL (option D) provides a URL that is scoped to a specific procedure or function,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
potentially improving security and control over data access. However, it does not inherently bypass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
authentication and authorization requirements for accessing the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Therefore, GET_PRESIGNED_URL is the only function that fulfills the requirement of providing a URL that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
grants access to a file on a stage without the need for additional authentication and authorization at the time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
of access, because the authorization is baked into the URL itself.

The correct answer is CSV (Comma Separated Values).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Floating-point value truncation occurs when unloading data containing floating-point numbers to a CSV file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
due to CSV's inherent lack of strict data typing. CSV files are essentially plain text files where data fields are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
separated by commas. The precision and formatting of numeric values are not enforced by the CSV standard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Unlike more sophisticated file formats like Avro, ORC, and Parquet, CSV doesn't explicitly store data types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
When Snowflake unloads floating-point data to a CSV file, it effectively converts the numeric values to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
strings. While Snowflake attempts to preserve the numeric representation, certain formatting settings and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
the limitations of string representation can lead to truncation, especially for numbers with many decimal

representation that avoids the conversion to strings and the associated loss of precision that might occur

The lack of schema in CSV files makes them susceptible to interpretation errors by

BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL generates a URL that includes a temporary token for accessing a

The token's validity is time-bound, and therefore, a new URL generated at a later time, for the

Similarly, GET_PRESIGNED_URL creates a URL that grants temporary access to a file in a

These credentials have an expiration time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Consequently, successive calls with identical inputs will generate different URLs because the embedded

When loading data using the COPY INTO TABLE command, file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
format options can be specified at different levels: table definition, stage definition, session level, and the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
COPY INTO TABLE statement itself. Snowflake follows a precedence order for applying these options. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
COPY INTO TABLE statement takes the highest precedence, meaning any file format options defined directly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
within this statement override any options set at other levels. This allows for granular control over the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
loading process for specific operations, even when default options exist elsewhere. Following the COPY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
statement, if there are no specific file format options provided, it then looks at the options specified within the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
stage definition (B) , then the session-level (C) then finally, the table definition (A) to fallback onto a default .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This hierarchical approach ensures flexibility and allows you to manage file format settings at different levels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
of scope. You can specify options relevant to all loads at the table level, options specific to a data source at                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the stage level and then specific file format options when you load the data into tables. If no options areprovided at any of these layers, then snowflake defaults to the file format of CSV. The explicit definition in the                                                                                                                                                       
COPY command allows you to override the defaults from session, stage, and table. This approach allows

The correct answer is C. file_extension. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
When unloading data from a Snowflake relational table to a CSV file in an external stage, the fileformat options control how the data is structured and formatted within the output file. The user's                                                                                                                                                                                
requirement is that the table name must be reflected exactly in the filename, implying we need a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
mechanism to customize the file's naming. While options like encoding (A) and escape (B) deal

directly control the filename. The file_extension (C) format option allows specifying the suffix of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
the generated output files, for example, .csv, which ensures the file is recognised as a CSV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Crucially, the naming convention itself is often handled via the COPY INTO statement's PATTERN

Therefore, while file_extension completes the file name, the PATTERN is used to precisely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
align the filename with the table name. Snowflakeâ€™s COPY INTO syntax enables using wildcards

function of STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY when loading JSON data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Option B, "Unload the records from separate table rows," is incorrect because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY is a load-specific option used during the COPY INTO operation. It doesn't

Option C, "Export data files in smaller chunks," is also incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
File chunking is related to data loading from external stages and not related to the parsing of

Lastly, option D, "Ensure each unique element stores values of a single native

The correct answer is C: CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT my_format TYPE=JSON; This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
because Snowflake, like many database systems, doesn't offer a direct ALTER command to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
change the core type of a file format. Instead, to redefine a file format with a new type, a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
replacement is required. Option A, ALTER FILE FORMAT my_format SET TYPE=JSON;, is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
incorrect because Snowflake's ALTER command for file formats primarily modifies existing

Options B, ALTER FILE FORMAT

are also invalid because Snowflake doesn't have a SWAP or REPLACE command for file formats in

The CREATE OR REPLACE command is designed for situations where you need to modify a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
schema object fundamentally. By using CREATE OR REPLACE, we are effectively creating a new                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
file format definition that overwrites the existing one if it exists. This ensures that all subsequent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
operations utilizing my_format will interpret the data as JSON, and it also handle the cases if the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
file format does not exists initially. This aligns with the idempotent nature of infrastructure as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
code; repeatedly executing this command will result in the same desired state. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
CREATE OR REPLACE is the proper way to change the underlying file format type in Snowflake.

A Snowflake user needs to import a JSON file larger than 16 MB.

The question pertains to handling large JSON files (over 16 MB) in Snowflake, which has                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
limitations on single record size during data loading. The key challenge is that Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
internally converts JSON into a tabular structure where each top-level element becomes a row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
When a single JSON object, exceeding 16MB, is provided, Snowflake will error out because the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
row size is too large. The strip_outer_array option directly addresses this. When set to TRUE,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake processes the file as if the outer JSON array, when present, isn't a single record, but                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
rather a series of independent top-level JSON objects, effectively creating multiple rows and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
avoiding the single-record size limitation. In the given context, the JSON data is within an array,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
and by setting strip_outer_array = TRUE will make each object in the array treated as a separate

Option A trim_space = true is used to remove leading/trailing whitespace in string values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option B compression = auto automatically detects and handles compressed files, which is useful

Option D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
strip_outer_array = false is the default, this would cause Snowflake to see the entire file content

The correct answer is C, NULL_IF. This option specifically controls how SQL NULL values are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
represented when unloading data to a file. When using the CSV file format, Snowflake, by default,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
represents NULL values as empty strings. However, to represent them explicitly as the string                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
'null', the NULL_IF option is employed. By setting NULL_IF = ('null') within the COPY INTO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
command, we instruct Snowflake to replace NULL values with the string 'null' in the resulting CSV

scenario of quoted fields. It allows you to specify the character (single quote or double quote)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
used to enclose fields, ensuring that values containing commas, for example, are treated as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
single field. This is a common practice in CSV file creation to avoid data parsing errors. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
when the requirement specifies single or double quotes enclosing the fields,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY is the direct and correct option to use within Snowflake.

In a columnar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
format, data is stored by columns rather than rows, which allows Snowflake to read only the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
necessary columns for a query, significantly reducing I/O operations and improving query speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
This is particularly beneficial for analytical workloads that typically involve aggregations and

The correct answer is indeed D. Parquet. Parquet is a columnar storage file format specifically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
designed for efficient data storage and retrieval, particularly beneficial for analytical workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Unlike row-based formats like Avro and JSON, Parquet organizes data by column, allowing for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
faster read operations when only a subset of columns is needed.

The correct answer is D. SHOW FILE FORMATS. This is because the SHOW command in Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
is specifically designed to list existing database objects, including file formats. It provides a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
convenient way to enumerate available objects without requiring detailed descriptions. Option A,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
LIST, is used for listing files within stages, not for listing file formats. Option B, ALTER FILE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
FORMAT, is used to modify the properties of an existing file format, not to display a list. Option C,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT, provides a detailed description of a specific file format, including its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
properties and settings, but not a list of all file formats accessible to a user. To list all file formats,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
the SHOW FILE FORMATS command is the most appropriate. Snowflakeâ€™s Role-Based Access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Control (RBAC) model determines which file formats are accessible to a particular user based on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
their granted privileges. The SHOW FILE FORMATS command respects this access control,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
displaying only those formats the user has permission to see. In contrast, other options likeALTER and DESCRIBE either modify existing definitions or require a specific file format name, and                                                                                                                                                                                      
thus arenâ€™t suitable for listing. SHOW commands are generally used to retrieve metadata,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
whereas DESCRIBE retrieves specific details and ALTER modifies objects.

FILE_EXTENSION file format option directly dictates the file extension used for theunloaded data files, effectively determining the file type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
FILE_EXTENSION and Output Format: This option is what ultimately tells Snowflake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
how to structure the data written to the stage.

unloading data regularly, consistency is crucial. Using a named file format ensures that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
the output files adhere to the same standard format each time, facilitating downstream                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
processing and analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Moreover, named file formats enhance code reusability. Instead of embedding file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
format options directly within the unload commands, you simply reference the named

It also allows for easy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
standardization across multiple data pipelines. If the underlying data structure or format
