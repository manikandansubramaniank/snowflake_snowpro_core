The statement is True. Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing service, provides functionality to unload(export) structured data from its tables and views into various file formats. Importantly, this includes semistructured formats like JSON and Parquet. Unloading to JSON allows for representing data as nested objects,

Choosing the correct compression format can also optimize downstream

The correct answer is A and C. Snowflake supports unloading data into delimited formats like CSV and TSV,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
as well as JSON. Delimited formats are common for exporting tabular data into plain text files where values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
are separated by a specific character (comma, tab, etc.). This is efficient for downstream systems that expect

JSON, on the other hand, is a lightweight data-interchange format that is widely used

Its flexibility makes it suitable for handling complex data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
structures, often preferred when dealing with semi-structured data within Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
While Snowflake has connectors and external functions to interact with various data sources and formats,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
including Avro and ORC, its primary native support for unloading is confined to CSV/TSV and JSON formats.Avro and ORC are more relevant for use in data loading and staging, typically used with platforms like Hadoop                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
or Kafka and not for native exporting from snowflake. Directly writing to Avro or ORC requires using external                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
functions or other connectors, which goes beyond the core capabilities of Snowflake's COPY INTO command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
(for exporting).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Therefore, A (Delimited) and C (JSON) correctly reflect the two formats natively supported for exporting data

the location defined by the stage.Option B, EXPORT TO @stage, is not a valid Snowflake SQL command. Option C, INSERT INTO @stage, is also                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
incorrect, as INSERT INTO is used for loading data into Snowflake tables, not exporting it out to a stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Finally, Option D, EXPORT_TO_STAGE(stage => @stage, select => 'select * from t1');, presents a syntax that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
doesn't align with the available Snowflake commands for exporting data and includes an attempt to pass

The correct answer is D. Define an individual file format. When unloading data from Snowflake to a stage,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
specifying a dedicated file format offers significant advantages for data management and interoperability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Rather than relying on default settings or assuming uniformity, a custom file format allows precise control

minimizing potential parsing errors or data transformation steps later on. Specifically, explicit definitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
provide consistency, making the data predictable and reliable. This also makes collaborating and sharing data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
with others simpler because of the consistent formatting. Option A is incorrect because setting SINGLE =                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
TRUE is intended to create a single large output file. This is not always desirable because it can be difficult to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
handle, is slow to download, and does not leverage parallelism well. Option B is also incorrect,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(*) is specifically used with JSON, not Parquet. Furthermore, this could make complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
data more difficult to parse in downstream systems. Finally, Option C is incorrect because CAST is often

A. When unloading semi-structured data, it is recommended that the STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY option be used.<br>B. Use the ENCODING file format option to change the encoding from the default UTF-8.<br>C. The OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function can be used to convert relational data to semi-structured data.<br>D. By using the SINGLE = TRUE parameter, a single file up to 5 GB in size can be exported to the storage layer.<br>E. Use the PARSE_JSON function to ensure structured data will be unloaded into the VARIANT data type.

Let's break down why options C and D are correct for unloading data from Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option C is valid because the OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function allows you to transform relational data (tabular                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
data with rows and columns) into semi-structured data (like JSON or Avro). This is crucial when you want to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
unload data in a format more suitable for downstream systems that expect semi-structured data. The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function essentially builds JSON objects from the columns of your table during the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
unload process. This provides flexibility in how your data is represented when it leaves Snowflake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option D is also accurate. Setting SINGLE = TRUE in your COPY INTO statement when unloading datainstructs Snowflake to create a single output file. While Snowflake typically distributes unloaded data across                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
multiple files for parallelism, SINGLE = TRUE combines everything into one. The caveat is that this single file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
has a size limitation of 5 GB. This can be useful for smaller datasets or when a single file is required by the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
destination system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Option A is incorrect. STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY is generally used when loading semi-structured data to remove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
the outermost array if the file contains a single array of objects. It's not relevant for unloading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Option B is incorrect. While Snowflake does support different encodings, the ENCODING file format option is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
used when loading data into Snowflake, not when unloading. The default encoding for unloading is UTF-8, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
generally, you don't need to change it unless dealing with very specific edge cases that are outside the scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
of typical unloading operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option E is incorrect because PARSE_JSON is a function used for loading JSON data into a VARIANT column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
It is not for unloading. When unloading data from a VARIANT column, Snowflake will automatically convert it

After                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
unloading data from Snowflake to a stage, it's crucial to verify the files have been successfully placed there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The LIST command serves this purpose, providing a way to inspect the contents of the stage and confirm the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
existence of the unloaded data files. It essentially provides a directory listing of the stage's contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option B, show @file_stage, is incorrect. The SHOW command is generally used to display information about

'file_stage'). It doesn't list the files within the stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option C, view @file_stage, is syntactically incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Snowflake.

When unloading data from Snowflake to cloud storage (like AWS S3, Azure Blob                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) without explicitly specifying a compression type, Snowflake defaults to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
gzip compression. This is a standard, widely supported compression algorithm that provides a reasonable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
balance between compression ratio and processing speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Snowflake's choice of gzip as the default is pragmatic. It ensures that unloaded data is compressed by

Snowflake's COPY INTO command, when used with an internal stage, places the unloaded data files within                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Snowflake's storage environment. These files are not automatically accessible on the user's local file system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
To move these files from the internal stage to the local machine, a separate command is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The GET command in Snowflake is specifically designed for this purpose. It downloads files from a specified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
stage location (like the internal stage used by the COPY INTO command) to a client-side location. It acts as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
retrieval mechanism, moving the data out of Snowflake's internal storage and onto the user's local machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option B, LIST, is used to view the contents of a stage, but it does not download files. Option C, PUT, is used to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
upload files to a stage, the opposite operation of what's required here. Option D, REMOVE, is used to delete                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
files from a stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, following a COPY INTO ... @internal_stage command, the GET command is the necessary and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
correct command to download the unloaded data files to the local file system.

Stages in Snowflake act as intermediary storage areas for data, either internal or external.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
When exporting data, the COPY INTO command retrieves the information from a source within Snowflake and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
writes it to files within the designated stage location. These files can then be accessed and used by other

The correct answer is A, stating that Snowflake assigns each unloaded data file a unique name. Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
bulk unloading process, primarily achieved through the COPY INTO command, generates uniquely namedfiles to prevent overwriting and to facilitate efficient data management. When unloading to an external stage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
(like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage), Snowflake automatically creates these distinct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
file names. This uniqueness is generally achieved by incorporating a combination of a timestamp, a sequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
number, or a UUID into the filename. This naming convention is crucial for parallel processing and for reliably

creates files in the specified stage using Snowflake's own internal mechanisms, making option B incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
While COPY INTO is indeed used for bulk unloading, the default behavior isn't SINGLE = TRUE (option C); the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
default is to create multiple files based on data distribution and stage settings, meaning option C is also

Furthermore, while unloading often involves external stages, it's not the only destination

Therefore, the automatic assignment of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
unique names to unloaded files is a fundamental part of how Snowflake manages bulk unloading, ensuring

This allows for easy management and prevents conflicts when unloading data

A. Use Parquet as the unload file format, using Parquet's default compression feature.<br>B. Use a regular expression in the stage specification of the COPY command to restrict parsing time.<br>C. Increase the default MAX_FILE_SIZE to 5 GB and set SINGLE = true to produce a single file.<br>D. Leave the default MAX_FILE_SIZE to 16 MB to take advantage of parallel operations.

The most performant approach for unloading a 5GB table to CSV in Snowflake involves leveraging parallel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
operations. Option D, leaving the MAX_FILE_SIZE at its default of 16MB, is the correct strategy. Snowflake's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
architecture is designed to process data in parallel. By allowing it to split the data into multiple, smaller files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
(16MB each by default), the unload process can be distributed across multiple nodes and executed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
concurrently. This significantly reduces the overall unload time compared to forcing a single large file.

Parquet (Option A) is generally more efficient than CSV for loading and unloading due to its columnar storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
and compression, but the question specifically requires CSV, making Option A irrelevant. Option B, using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
regular expressions to restrict parsing, is not applicable to unloading; regexes are generally used when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
loading data. Option C, increasing MAX_FILE_SIZE and setting SINGLE = true, would force Snowflake to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
create a single 5GB file. This would negate the benefits of parallelism and be considerably slower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Snowflake's internal load/unload processes perform best when they can work in smaller chunks. Therefore,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
by sticking with the default MAX_FILE_SIZE and avoiding SINGLE=TRUE, the user can maximize

The default file size for data unloaded from Snowflake is indeed 16 MB. Snowflake automatically splits output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
files into multiple parts when unloading large datasets, and these parts, by default, are roughly 16 MB each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
This size is a balance between having manageable, parallelizable files for downstream processing and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
minimizing the overhead of managing many small files. If the total amount of data being unloaded is less than                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 MB, Snowflake will create a single file containing all the data.

A. The default value for the SINGLE option is set to TRUE.<br>B. By default, COPY INTO statements do not separate table data into a set of output files.<br>C. The OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function can be combined with the COPY command to convert the rows in a<br>D. If the COMPRESSION option is set to TRUE, a file's name can be specified with the appropriate file extension

The correct answer is C because it accurately describes a valid method for unloading data using the COPY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
INTO command in Snowflake. Specifically, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT allows you to transform the rows of a table

object. This is a key functionality when exporting data that's not in a simple tabular format. Option A is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
incorrect because the default value for the SINGLE option is FALSE, meaning Snowflake creates multiple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
output files by default for parallel processing. Option B is incorrect as well because the COPY INTO statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
will default to create multiple files if the SINGLE=TRUE parameter is not set. Regarding option D, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
COMPRESSION parameter is not a boolean, it takes a compression type, and you don't specify file extensions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
directly in the COPY INTO statement but rather the file format. It is the FILE_FORMAT parameter that

The correct answer is B. Unload the data directly to the cloud storage location. Snowflake is designed to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
interact directly with cloud storage services (like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
for both loading and unloading data. This direct integration is a core principle of Snowflake's architecture,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
promoting efficiency and minimizing intermediate steps. Using the COPY INTO command, Snowflake can                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
write data directly to a specified stage, which points to an external cloud storage location, without needing alocal file system or additional tools.

COPY INTO is for loading data into tables from stages, not for unloading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
PUT is for uploading files to a stage, not for downloading them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
TRANSFER is not a valid Snowflake command.

The COPY INTO command in Snowflake, when used to unload data to a stage with a specified file format,

SELECT statement constructs a single JSON object using OBJECT_CONSTRUCT which results in a single                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
record to be unloaded. Snowflake, by default, compresses files written to stages for optimized storage and

Because the SELECT statement only generates a single row, Snowflake will generate a single                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
output file containing the JSON object. Within the JSON file, all the data is presented within a single VARIANT

VARIANT column in Snowflake can store semi-structured data like JSON. Hence, the output is a single                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
compressed JSON file with a single VARIANT-like column represented as the JSON object itself.

not split into multiple files because the dataset resulting from the SQL statement contains only one record.

to download the files to a local Windows directory on the C drive within a folder named "folder with space."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Option A correctly employs the GET command with the stage name and the local file path as arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Importantly, the syntax file://C:\folder with space\ accurately specifies the Windows file path, including the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
backslashes used in Windows paths. The trailing backslash indicates the directory where the files should be

Snowflake understands the syntax of file paths in the machine where the command is executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B uses forward slashes in a Windows path, which might not be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
interpreted correctly by the Windows client in all cases. Options C and D incorrectly utilize the PUT command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
PUT is used to upload data files to a Snowflake stage, not to download data from a Snowflake stage. Also, the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
wildcards are not valid in local paths for GET command. The syntax in C and D is also incorrect for the local

Without this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Snowflake might create multiple files, especially for larger datasets, to optimize parallel

This is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
because Snowflake automatically partitions and parallelizes the unloading process for

The correct combination for converting relational table rows into a single VARIANT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
column and unloading them as JSON files involves OBJECT_CONSTRUCT and COPY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
OBJECT_CONSTRUCT is a Snowflake function that transforms multiple columns within                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
a row into a single JSON object, structured as a VARIANT data type. This is crucial for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
the initial conversion process where individual columns of the table are grouped into a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
single, nested JSON structure. Subsequently, the COPY command in Snowflake is the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
mechanism to export data from a table, including data that is stored as a VARIANT, to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
file on an external or internal stage. Crucially, it supports the specification of the file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
format, in this case, JSON. The combination allows the structured data to be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
manipulated into the desired nested JSON format, and then exported. PUT and GET are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
generally for stage management rather than data transformation and exporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
EXPORT is not a standard Snowflake command for data unloading.

In this process, TO_JSON is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
used as part of the SELECT statement to produce the JSON output. Without TO_JSON,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
the output will likely remain in a tabular or delimited format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Essentially, the TO_JSON function serves as the critical transformation element,

A. The result set will be successfully downloaded from Snowsight.<br>B. The result set will be automatically compressed and the data will be downloaded as individual files.<br>C. The download will fail because the result set needs to be broken up into files no greater than 50 MB before<br>D. The download will result in an error because the filters of the SELECT query need to be changed so that

A. Use the OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function in conjunction with the COPY INTO command.<br>B. Use the COPY INTO command with the file_format set as JSON.<br>C. Use the PUT command with the file_format set as JSON.<br>D. Use the GET command with the file_format set as JSON.

The correct answer is A: "Use the OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function in conjunction with the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
COPY INTO command." Here's why: Snowflake's COPY INTO command is designed for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
data loading and unloading, primarily to and from external stages. When unloading to a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
file format other than CSV (like JSON), you need to transform your relational data into                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
the desired structure. The OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function within Snowflake allows you
