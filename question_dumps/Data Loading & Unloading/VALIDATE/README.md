The SQL command SELECT FROM TABLE(VALIDATE(t1, job_id => '_last')) is used in Snowflake to retrieve

when run against table t1. The VALIDATE function, when combined with job_id => '_last', retrieves results

The correct answer is D, VALIDATION_MODE. The COPY command in Snowflake is primarily used for loading                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
data from staged files into a table. However, before actually loading, it's often desirable to check the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
files for potential errors without impacting the target table. This is achieved using the VALIDATION_MODE                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The VALIDATION_MODE parameter allows you to test the compatibility of your data files against the table's                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
schema and data types without actually ingesting the data. When VALIDATION_MODE is set, the COPY                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
command simulates the load operation and returns information about any errors or warnings that would occur                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
during a real load. This validation includes checks for data type mismatches, field length constraints, not null                                                                                                                                                                                                               
constraints, and other data quality issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Options A, B, and C address different data handling aspects during loading but don't provide a mechanism for                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
pre-loading validation. STRIP_NULL_VALUES relates to handling null values, SKIP_BYTE_ORDER_MARKhandles byte order mark issues in files, and REPLACE_INVALID_CHARACTERS helps resolve invalid                                                                                                                                   
characters during the load process. None of these options simulate a load to verify the data files' compliance                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
with the target table schema before the actual load occurs. Therefore, they cannot instruct the copy                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
command to verify data files instead of loading. Only VALIDATION_MODE directly serves this purpose by                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
performing a dry-run of the load operation.

The correct answer is D, JOB_ID. The VALIDATE table function in Snowflake is used to examine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
the validity of data that is being loaded or has been loaded into a table. It provides information                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
about data quality issues, such as parsing errors or type mismatches. The JOB_ID parameter is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
crucial because it specifies the particular data loading job to analyze. Snowflake assigns a unique                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
job ID to each load operation. By providing this ID, you are directing the VALIDATE function to

not data loading jobs. These identifiers relate to actions taken by users via SQL statements, not                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
the execution of file loading. Option C, UUID_STRING, is a universally unique identifier string, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
while UUIDs are generally used within Snowflake, they are not the direct identifier to use with the                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
VALIDATE table function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The VALIDATE function is tightly coupled to the loading processes and their IDs, ensuring precise
