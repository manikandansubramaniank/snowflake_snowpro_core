The correct answer, SINGLE=FALSE, enables Snowflake to unload data into multiple files when using theCOPY INTO command. Here's a detailed justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The COPY INTO command in Snowflake facilitates the unloading of data from a Snowflake table or view into                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
external stages (like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage). By default, when unloading                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
data, Snowflake attempts to create a single output file. However, large datasets often benefit from being split                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
into multiple smaller files for parallel processing, improved load times in downstream systems, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
potentially reduced storage costs due to better compression opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The SINGLE parameter controls this behavior. When SINGLE=TRUE (or when the parameter is omitted, as it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
defaults to TRUE), Snowflake creates a single output file. When SINGLE=FALSE, Snowflake divides the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
output into multiple files. The number and size of these files depend on the size of the data being unloaded                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
and Snowflake's internal optimization algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Specifying SINGLE=FALSE is essential when you want to leverage the parallelism offered by other tools or

enabling "multiple" files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, SINGLE=FALSE is the appropriate option to unload data into multiple files using the COPY INTO

Option A, SINGLE = 0, is incorrect because SINGLE expects a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE), not

This default behavior is crucial for

The correct answer is B. Use the PURGE copy option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The PURGE copy option in Snowflake's COPY INTO command is specifically designed to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
remove staged files after they have been successfully loaded into a table. This is a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
crucial feature for managing storage and preventing accidental re-loading of data. When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
a COPY INTO command is executed without the PURGE option, the staged files remain in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
the stage location even after data has been loaded successfully. If you re-run the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
COPY INTO command with the same files, Snowflake will detect them as duplicate rows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
unless data has changed. The PURGE option ensures that once data is successfully

data duplication during subsequent load operations and optimizing storage by avoiding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
keeping unnecessary copies of your staged data after being loaded. DROP command

manage files in a stage. FORCE=TRUE (Option C) allows data loading even with errors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
that would normally prevent it. LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES (Option D) helps load files that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
might have minor issues, it doesn't remove files from stage locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Using the PURGE option promotes efficient storage management practices by cleaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
up the stage after loading. It also streamlines the loading process by preventing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
unintended duplicate loads from existing staged files, and ensures that stage space is
