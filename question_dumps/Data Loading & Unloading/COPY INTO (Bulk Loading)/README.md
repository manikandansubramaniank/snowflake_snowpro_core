delimiters, escape characters or other transformations, explicit file format specification becomes crucial.

best practice is to always explicitly state the file format to maintain clarity, avoid misinterpretations, and

The absence of file format specifications might lead to

Snowflake performs optimally with compressed data files between 100MB and 250MB. This size provides a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
good balance, allowing for efficient parallel processing and minimizing overhead. Option C is correct because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
when dealing with delimited files, enclosing fields containing the delimiter characters within quotes ensures

Option A, compressing the file, won't solve the problem. Compression reduces file size but doesn't alter the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
size of individual JSON objects parsed by Snowflake. The same overly large JSON value will still trigger the

Option B, splitting the file, is partially helpful but doesn't address the root cause. While smaller files are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
generally good practice for parallel processing, the oversized JSON value within any of those files will still                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
result in the same error. Splitting will only distribute the occurrence of the error, not eliminate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Option C, using a larger warehouse, will not resolve the LOB size limitation.

size is a system limitation independent of warehouse resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Option D, setting STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY=TRUE, is the most likely solution because it addresses the structure

The COPY INTO command (option B) is used for the next step in the data loading process. It retrieves the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
files that are already present in a stage and loads that data into a Snowflake table. Therefore, COPY INTO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
relies on the data files already being available in a stage, which is achieved through the PUT command.

INTO doesn't move files to a stage; it moves data from a stage to a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The GET command is used to download data files from a Snowflake stage to your local machine, the reverse

Let's break down why options C and D are the recommended best practices for loading data into Snowflake,

Option C (Load files that are approximately 100-250 MB or larger) is a best practice: Snowflake performs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
optimally when loading larger files. Smaller files introduce overhead from file handling, network latency, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
metadata management, impacting overall load efficiency. Larger files allow Snowflake to process data in

between 100-250 MB but can be even larger for optimal performance. The rationale here is that there's an I/O

Snowflake's COPY INTO command, when used with an internal stage, employs a file tracking mechanism to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
prevent duplicate data ingestion. This mechanism primarily relies on metadata associated with the files on the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
stage, rather than the data within the files. When you initially load the 10 files, Snowflake records their names                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
and locations in the stage. When the same COPY INTO command is executed again without modifying the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
stage definition, Snowflake recognizes that the initial 10 files were already processed. Consequently, it will                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
skip these files because their metadata has already been recorded, effectively preventing duplicate ingestion.Thus, even though the stage now contains 20 files, only the 10 new files added after the initial load will be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
processed during the second COPY INTO execution. This default behavior ensures that only new or changed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
files are processed during subsequent runs of the same command, preventing duplicate data from being

It is important to note this is only in cases where COPY INTO is not provided with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
pattern matching, that is, explicitly stating the files or using pattern matching that picks up newly added files.

Option A is incorrect because, as explained, Snowflake tracks loaded files and avoids reprocessing them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option B is inaccurate because, while only new data from the new files will be inserted, Snowflakeâ€™s default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
behaviour will not do any data comparison, only file tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Option C is incorrect because the operation will not fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Key takeaway: Snowflake's default behavior with COPY INTO is to only ingest newly added files from a stage

The correct answer is C: In the metadata of the target table for 64 days. Let's break down why.

This history isn't stored in a separate log file you have to manage; instead, it's maintained as metadata

This design makes it easy to query and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
analyze load history related to a specific table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Why store it as table metadata? Because the loading history is intrinsically linked to the table's data integrity

Knowing when and how data was loaded is crucial for auditing, troubleshooting, and

The retention period for this bulk data load history is 64 days. After this period, the historical information is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
purged from Snowflake's metadata. This timeframe provides a reasonable window for investigation without                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
unduly burdening the metadata storage. Option A and B mentions 14 days which is wrong, and option D says                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
the data is kept in pipe's metadata which is also wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Pipes are used for continuous data ingestion, not bulk loading. While pipes do have their own metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
related to their operational status and error logs, the bulk data load history we're discussing is specifically

This means that the original uncompressed file can be larger than 16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
MB, but after Snowflake compresses it, the resulting compressed file must be 16 MB or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
If a compressed file exceeds this limit, the COPY command will fail with an error indicating that the file is too

The correct answer is CD. Let's break down why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The PUT command in Snowflake is primarily used to stage data files from your local machine or network onto

It does this preparatory work for loading data into Snowflake tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Option C is correct because PUT automatically compresses files using GZIP compression by default during

This is beneficial for transferring data efficiently by reducing file sizes and consequently,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
transfer time. This is an automatic process, it does not require additional specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Option D is also correct.

Option A is incorrect. PUT does not create file format objects. File formats are separate objects that must be

Option B is incorrect as PUT requires the user to explicitly specify the stage to put the file into using a stage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
URL in the command. It does not pick a last stage created automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Option E is also incorrect. PUT simply stages files and does not perform data loading or table creation tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Table creation and data loading require separate SQL commands. Therefore, an empty target table isn't

In summary, PUT command automatically compresses data via GZIP and encrypts it in transit with TLS/SSL

massive file set, this repeated evaluation for each file will drastically slow down the loading process, as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Snowflake has to iterate through all filenames. This overhead is minimized when no PATTERN is specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Conversely, parameters like FILE_FORMAT (which specifies format like CSV, JSON, etc.) and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
VALIDATION_MODE (which controls error handling) are crucial configurations for data loading and their                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
impact on performance is less about the sheer number of files but more about the complexity of the operation

The FILES parameter, which can be used to list specific files instead of using pattern matching,

when no pattern is specified by default all files in stage are processed. Therefore, applying pattern matching

It is important to note that optimized pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
matching and using a pattern only when needed are still best practices when needing to load a subset of files.

The correct answer is A. FORCE = TRUE. The COPY command in Snowflake is designed to load data from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
external stages into Snowflake tables. Snowflake meticulously tracks the loading status of files to prevent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
accidental duplicate data loading. By default, if Snowflake detects a file has already been loaded, it will skip                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
that file. However, there are situations where you may need to reload files even if Snowflake has recordedthem as previously loaded. This is when the FORCE option comes into play. Setting FORCE = TRUE explicitly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
instructs Snowflake to ignore any prior loading status of files and attempt to load them regardless of whether

This overrides Snowflake's default duplicate prevention mechanism, ensuring all

significantly benefit from having multiple smaller files rather than one large file. A single large file would limit

Files in the 100-250 MB range generally provide an optimal balance between parallelism and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
overhead. Larger files might still limit parallelism to some extent. Uncompressed files (options B and D)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
increase transfer time and costs. Option A, while using compression, would not benefit from parallelism.

When a list of specific files is provided, Snowflake can optimize the data retrieval process by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
skipping any unnecessary lookups or pattern matching operations. This directness leads to lower latency and

The correct answer is B. The COPY INTO options should be set to FORCE = TRUE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Snowflake's COPY INTO command, by default, prevents loading duplicate files. It keeps track of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
which files have been successfully ingested based on file paths and last modified timestamps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
When it encounters the same file again (same path and timestamp), it skips the load to prevent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
data duplication. This mechanism ensures data integrity and prevents unintended overwriting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
However, situations arise where you might genuinely need to reload a file, potentially due to data

This option overrides the default deduplication behavior, telling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Snowflake to proceed regardless of whether it's confident the files are new. The other options do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
not fulfill the requirement. The FORCE option forces the load but does not address expiredmetadata issues. VALIDATION_MODE is for validating the data without loading it, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
LAST_MODIFIED deals with timestamp criteria, not expired metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Therefore, LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES is the appropriate option to use when you want to load files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
with expired load metadata, despite the risk of potential duplicates. This allows loading files even                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
when Snowflakeâ€™s tracking mechanism has lost certainty about their load status, potentially

A. Create small data files and stage them in cloud storage frequently.<br>B. Create large data files to maximize the processing overhead for each file.<br>C. The number of load operations that run in parallel can exceed the number of data files to be loaded.<br>D. The number of data files that are processed in parallel is determined by the virtual warehouse.

Option B is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
incorrect; processing large individual files can limit parallelism and become a bottleneck, as one

COPY INTO command is used to load data from external or internal stages into Snowflake tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
During this process, you often need to validate if the data is loaded successfully or if any errors

You can use characters like pipes (|), tabs (\t),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
or any other single-character delimiter using the FIELD_DELIMITER option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Option C is incorrect because while compression can significantly reduce storage and

Option D, while seemingly plausible, isn't strictly enforced during loading and is an

to map data appropriately, allowing for different structures between source and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
destination. Furthermore, the COPY INTO command permits column omission (option B).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
You don't necessarily have to load all columns from the source file into the target table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
If some columns in the source aren't needed in the destination, they can be omitted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
without affecting the loading process. This is beneficial for handling extraneous data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
and loading only required information. However, COPY INTO command does not support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
transformations like JOIN (option C), which combines rows from different tables,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
FLATTEN (option D), which expands semi-structured data, or GROUP BY (option E),                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
which aggregates data. These transformations are more appropriately handled using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
SQL queries (e.g., CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, INSERT INTO with SELECT) after the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
is loaded into Snowflake. The COPY INTO command focuses primarily on the bulk

The correct answer is AC. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
When loading data from stages into Snowflake tables, Snowflake tracks file metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
(e.g., file name, size, last modified time) to prevent duplicate loading. This metadata has
